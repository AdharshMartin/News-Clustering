Fake Students Plague California Community Colleges, Displacing Real Enrollees	Fake Students Plague California Community Colleges, Displacing Real Enrollees Authored by Kimberley Hayek via The Epoch Times,California’s community colleges are grappling with a surge in fraudulent enrollments, with 1.2 million fake applicants last year accounting for nearly 30 percent of new students, blocking real students from classes and costing millions in stolen financial aid, according to college officials.The problem, exacerbated by the shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, affects at least 90 of the state’s 116 campuses, said Marvin Martinez, chancellor of the Rancho Santiago Community College District, and Jeannie Kim, president of Santiago Canyon College.Before the pandemic, most classes were in-person, making fraud more difficult, Martinez said. But with 80 percent of courses moving online, bots and fake students can enroll from anywhere, including other states or countries.“It’s happened on a massive scale,” Martinez told Epoch TV’s California Insider host Siyamak Khorrami.“What’s made this situation of fraudulent enrollment so different than anything that I’ve seen before in my 36 years in higher ed is that it’s happened in almost 80 percent now of the campuses.”At Santiago Canyon College, fall 2024 enrollment initially spiked 10 percent to 13 percent, Kim said, but faculty discovered many registrants were fraudulent. In one anthropology course, administrators raised the enrollment cap by 30 daily, only for bots to fill slots instantly, leaving just 12 to 15 genuine students. Faculty identified fakes through non-engagement, identical assignments, or invalid contact details, like phone numbers tied to businesses or defunct entities. Removing fraudulent enrollments cut the college’s headcount by 10,000 to 12,000 spots, with some bad actors enrolled in up to five classes each.The fallout is severe. Real students are denied access to required courses, delaying graduations, certificates, and transfers to four-year universities.“Counselors saw the crestfallen faces of students unable to get classes they needed to graduate,” Kim said.Among faculty, morale has gone down as classes shrink to single digits, making them cost-inefficient yet necessary for student progress. “Faculty teach because they love their discipline, but it’s devastating to see classes dwindle,” Kim added. Low-enrollment classes were allowed to run, doubling budgetary strain to prioritize student needs. Financially, colleges face significant losses. California funds community colleges based on enrollment, but removing fake students can cut revenue by up to 23 percent, Martinez said. “You can’t get paid for fake enrollments,” he noted.“It’s better to make that cut upfront than face audits later.”In 2024, scammers stole $8.4 million in federal aid and $2.7 million in state aid, with losses since 2021 exceeding $18 million, state reports show. The colleges reported 20 to 25 identity theft cases, requiring notifications to victims and reports to the U.S. Department of Education.Fraud motivations include exploiting Pell Grants, with “Pell runners” collecting up to $7,400 before vanishing, and harvesting personal data such as Social Security numbers for identity theft, Martinez said. Perpetrators, often international, use AI tools such as ChatGPT to mimic students, targeting no-prerequisite courses such as accounting or business. To combat the issue, colleges are deploying LightLeap.AI, an artificial intelligence platform from N2N Services, initially developed for course predictions but adapted for fraud detection.Santiago Canyon adopted it for under $100,000 after Kim discovered it at a conference, and it is now scaled to 80 campuses statewide at about $75,000 per institution.Processing nearly 3 million applications and flagging 360,000 suspected fraudsters, LightLeap.AI uses machine learning to analyze shared phone numbers, IP addresses, minimal application data, and suspicious course-taking patterns, achieving a 99 percent accuracy rate at Santiago Canyon. “One art faculty member was ecstatic, saying, ‘I have a clean roster. They’re all real,’” Kim recalled.LightLeap.AI’s triangulation method cross-references application data with student information systems and proprietary blacklist/whitelist databases, identifying patterns such as multiple applications from one IP address. Operating in three stages—application, registration, and financial aid—it catches twice as many scammers as manual methods, freeing 7,500 seats for real students at Santiago Canyon. Its network effect allows fraud detection at one college to flag bad actors across 83 campuses, with a 92.3 percent effectiveness rate at West Valley-Mission. The system adapts to evolving tactics by incorporating geolocation data and reducing false positives through continuous learning. Since its intersession rollout, it has been applied across spring, summer, and fall terms, with updates to counter fraudsters’ use of generative AI.Implementing LightLeap.AI presents challenges.“We need tech-savvy staff, but community colleges can’t compete with tech industry salaries,” Martinez said. Budgets, unchanged in 20 years, hinder hiring, and manual verification tools like ID.me are voluntary and inadequate. A proposed $10 application fee, discussed in 2025, aims to deter fraud but risks burdening vulnerable students such as the homeless or undocumented, who struggle with ID verification. Online education is essential for working adults, who now outnumber recent high school graduates enrolled at community colleges. “Adult students—parents with jobs and bills—rely on online classes,” Martinez said. To support this shift, he urged Sacramento to increase funding for technology and staffing. “If it doesn’t happen, we’re going to keep losing money,” he warned. A 2025 state audit is evaluating fraud trends and mitigation effectiveness to guide future funding.“We’re easy prey because bureaucracies react slowly,” Martinez said.Kim emphasized ethical duty: “We’re public servants with a moral obligation to protect taxpayer dollars.” California community colleges serve about 1.8 million students annually, offering low-cost pathways to degrees and jobs.

Tylenol maker’s stock dips after report says RFK Jr.’s HHS plans to link the drug to autism	The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is planning to release a report that will reportedly link autism and acetaminophen use in pregnancy, according to The Wall Street Journal. The department has confirmed a report is in the works, but has not revealed its conclusions. Drug maker Kenvue, which sells acetaminophen under the brand name Tylenol, saw its shares slump following the Journal’s report, dropping more than 10% on Friday.Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ihas made investigating autism a cornerstone of his efforts at the department. According to the Journal, the report will also make a link between folate deficiency and autism. But in statements to other media outlets, an HHS spokesperson said the Journal’s reporting was “speculation.” “We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America’s unprecedented rise in autism rates,” a spokesperson for the department said.What the science says about acetaminophen and autismSome studies have found correlations between taking the common painkiller in pregnancy and the risk of children developing neurodevelopmental conditions. But these studies don’t prove a link, and other results suggest otherwise: A 2024 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) study—the largest on acetaminophen to date—found that there was no association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and increased risk of autism, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, or intellectual disability. The report comes months after Kennedy promised HHS would undertake a “massive testing and research effort” to find a cause for autism as soon as September. A mountain of research suggests that autism has no single cause, but is likely a combination of factors, including genetics. Kennedy has since walked that timeline back, telling CNN, “it will probably take us another six months.” No proven linkTylenol’s maker Kenvue told Fast Company in a statement that there is no proven link between acetaminophen and autism. “To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and leading medical organizations agree on the safety of acetaminophen, its use during pregnancy, and the information provided on the label.”“We advise expecting mothers to speak to their healthcare professionals before taking any over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, as they are best positioned to advise their patients on whether taking acetaminophen is appropriate based on their unique medical conditions.” The FDA has not found any “clear evidence” that acetaminophen during pregnancy “causes adverse pregnancy, birth, neurobehavioral, or developmental outcomes.” It also recommends that pregnant persons talk to their care providers before using any medications.Fast Company reached out to the department of Health and Human Services for comment, but did not hear back by the time of publication.	fastcompany	https://www.fastcompany.com/91399701/tylenol-stock-dips-report-rfkjr-hhs-link-acetaminophen-autism	2025-09-06 15:40:00

Darksiders 4: Release Date Info, Story, Trailer, And Everything Else We Know	"Darksiders 4 was officially announced in 2025 during a showcase for developer THQ Nordic, and many longtime fans of the franchise are curious about its release date, story, and gameplay. The last time we saw the Darksiders franchise was in 2019 with the release of Darksiders Genesis, a prequel to the original trilogy. This game was met with positive reviews from critics and fans alike, but after radio silence from THQ Nordic for several years, many players thought it could be the last time we'd see the Four Horsemen in action.Now, with Darksiders 4 confirmed, we finally get to see what THQ Nordic has been cooking up all of this time. We know the Four Horsemen are returning and picking up where they left off at the conclusion of the original Darksiders, but what else do we know about the fourth installment in the franchise? You can check out everything we know about Darksiders 4 in the guide below.When will Darksiders 4 be released?While we did get the reveal of Darksiders 4, THQ Nordic still has not given us a release date for the new action-RPG. Right now, the current release date is ""to be announced,"" and there's no indication as to when an announcement is expected.So, as of right now, we're pretty much in the dark when it comes to a release date for Darksiders 4. It's unclear how far along in development THQ Nordic is with the game, either, so we don't have anything to go on at the time of writing.Preorder Darksiders 4As we don't have a concrete release date for Darksiders 4, there's currently no way to preorder the game on any of its available platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S). This also means we don't know how much Darksiders 4 will cost. However, Darksiders has, in recent years, usually been priced under the industry standard for a new AAA game. For example, Darksiders III retailed for $40 at launch, and Darksiders Genesis came in at $30. THQ Nordic could take that same approach with Darksiders 4, which would put it at around $50-60, but it might also be a full-priced, $70 game.All you can do right now is wishlist the game's Standard Edition on PC via Steam. This gives you a notification when Darksiders 4 officially goes live for preorders.Watch the Darksiders 4 teaserIf you want a small glimpse into what THQ Nordic has in store with Darksiders 4, you can watch the official teaser trailer for the action-RPG below. Naturally, this is only a sneak peek at the game that confirms the return of the Four Horsemen. We'll have to wait for a proper trailer to see exactly what Darksiders 4 will look like.Darksiders 4 PlatformsDarksiders is coming to PC via Steam, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It's currently unknown if THQ Nordic will attempt to port the game to other platforms, such as Nintendo Switch 2, in the future. For now, though, Darksiders 4 will launch for only the current-gen platforms.Darksiders 4 Story, Setting, And CharactersAs we only have a small teaser trailer to go off, we don't know too much about the story of Darksiders 4. We do know that the game picks up at the conclusion of the original Darksiders, though, so the setting will still be the post-apocalyptic version of Earth that's remained prevalent throughout the franchise's life. The developers also said that the setting will take place over different realms within the post-apocalyptic landscape, and each realm has unique bosses, items, and visuals.During the game, you'll get to play as one of the Four Horsemen characters, who have become staples of the franchise. Death, Strife, Fury, and War are back in Darksiders 4, and you can choose which one to play as for a playthrough. Each of the Horsemen features different weapons, abilities, and playstyles, giving you more replayability options for second, third, and fourth playthroughs of the main story.Aside from the Four Horsemen, we're unsure of any additional characters in Darksiders 4. However, with the story starting from the end of the first game, it's a safe bet that some characters from the original will make an appearance.Darksiders 4 Gameplay And MultiplayerWhile we await more details and showcases of Darksiders 4, the developers have given us an idea of how the game will play. Just like the other games in the series, the fourth installment is a third-person action-RPG that emphasizes combat, narrative storytelling, and exploration through a lore-rich world.The combat in Darksiders 4 features up-close melee action and supernatural abilities that each of the characters possesses. These abilities can all likely be used in combat in some fashion, but other abilities could be more useful outside of engagements with enemies. In the case of Strife, we'll also likely be able to use his guns. Building on the cooperative feature in Genesis, it's also been confirmed that Darksiders 4 will support up to four people in cooperative play, with each controller one of the Four Horsemen.THQ Nordic specifies ""traversal and puzzle-solving"" as key components to the game. Darksiders is no stranger to unique movement and puzzles across the post-apocalypse, but the early marketing seems to suggest those elements will play a larger role in Darksiders 4. Some characters might offer more traversal abilities than others, which could give them an edge while exploring the map, while other characters might have abilities that make them tankier in battle.We still don't know a large chunk of how Darksiders 4 will look when it comes to gameplay, but THQ Nordic should be able to build off the foundation from the previous games in the franchise.Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google"	gamespot	https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darksiders-4-release-date-info-story-trailer-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6534456/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f	2025-09-06 16:00:00

Kaslo woman denied farmers' market stall blames 'spiritually violent people' in court	"A Kootenay woman who claimed that ""spiritually violent people"" were the reason she was refused a stall at the Kaslo Farmers' Market has lost an appeal after she took the matter to the BC Supreme Court.According to a recently published April 15 BC Supreme Court decision, Tamara Patricia Balla filed a BC Human Rights complaint against the Kootenay Lake Services Society and members Patrick Steiner, Kathy Allaire after she was refused a stall at the farmers' market to sell her homemade cards.""The exclusion of my stall was likely because of the interests of spiritually violent people,"" she told the Human Rights Tribunal. ""My knowledge of spiritual violence is such that both respondents will also be harmed spiritually unless the issue of spiritual violence is addressed for all.""The decision said Balla referred to a ""global and personally deeply distressing battle between spiritually violent and spiritually non-violent people."" She claimed the farmers' market's refusal to let her sell handmade cards had discriminated against her on the grounds of ancestry, place of origin, sex, gender identity, religion and political belief.After Balla filed her claim, the Human Rights Tribunal wrote back several times asking her to clarify her complaint.""(You) provided information about your understanding and belief of how spiritually violent persons invade and control spiritually non-violent persons. I am sorry to hear that you are feeling affected in this way. Your amendment appears to be asking the Tribunal to broaden your complaint to address this phenomenon,"" the decision read. ""Your complaint does not fall within the matters that the Tribunal can deal with.""After the Tribunal rejected her case, she wrote back saying the process was unfair and ""torturous.""""The tribunal members that are spiritually violent interfere with the process by using me and the spiritually non-violent population,"" Balla wrote.Undeterred, she appealed, asking for a reconsideration.Again, the Human Rights Tribunal told her it didn't deal with this phenomenon.""Your complaint does not allege facts that could contravene the Human Rights Code, and does not fall within the matters that the (Human Rights) Code can address,"" the Tribunal responded.Clearly undeterred, Balla then took the matter to the BC Supreme Court, asking for a judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.According to the Kootenay newspaper, The Valley Voice, Balla pinned her opening statements to the courthttps://www.valleyvoice.ca/_PDF_2016//ValleyVoice250313.web.pdf on her fence for anyone to look at.""Tamara's Hand Painted Cards"" and ""Crimes Against Humanity resources and information,"" the sign on her fence read.She's also written letters to the same newspaper and the Nelson Starhttps://www.nelsonstar.com/opinion/thoughts-on-the-meaning-of-soul-4897280 about spiritual violence against non-spiritually violent people.In her argument to the BC Supreme Court, Balla said the refusal to permit her to continue to have a card stall at the farmers' market violated her freedom of conscience and expression. ""(I) used the card stall to educate people about the conflict between spiritually violent and non-violent people, and she has, therefore, been prevented from continuing to engage in that sort of education,"" she claimed in the decision.""She also wrote that the process was not only unfair, but torturous, as spiritually violent people were using her mind as though it was a toy,"" BC Supreme Court Justice Lindsay Lyster said in the decision.However, the Justice ruled ""these are not the sorts of concerns"" that fall under the legal definition of procedural unfairness. ""The facts alleged by Ms. Balla related to the invasion and control of spiritually non-violent persons by spiritually violent persons. The facts alleged by Ms. Balla did not relate to acts of discrimination in the areas of employment or services or tenancy on any of the grounds that she relied upon in her complaint form,"" the Justice said.Ultimately, the Justice dismissed her appeal.To contact a reporter for this story, email Ben Bulmermailto:bbulmer@infonews.ca or call (250) 309-5230 or email the editormailto:news@infonews.ca.

“Is talking cringe now?”: Skit about “talking in 2025” goes viral—and the critiques are brutal	"A viral TikTok skit portraying a painfully awkward conversation has set off a wave of generational debate. The clip, from creator Mandy (@guyfieriwhore), shows a young woman shutting down every attempt at small talk, offering no opinions, no reactions, and no engagement. The text overlay on her video reads, ""POV you're trying to talk to people in 2025.""@guyfieriwhore/TikTokViewers linked the exaggerated scene to a real-world communication breakdown among Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Conversations across TikTok and Reddit debated whether younger generations have lost basic social skills, or if deeper cultural and pandemic-driven forces are at play.The TikTok has been viewed over 1.9 million times and has 316,000 likes.A viral skit and generational silenceThe video quickly reached Reddit, where it was reposted to the r/TikTokCringe subreddit. There, users claimed the behavior reflected a real communication breakdown among Gen Z and even Gen Alpha.One college assistant teacher said, ""I can confirm half of the students I have that are 18-20 are like this to talk to."" Another commenter, a body piercer, described younger customers as hiding behind ""this smoke screen of stupidity and ignorance to avoid being seen as cringe."" They added, ""The effect is that everyone under 25 seems 8.""Notably, several people tied this communication style to the pandemic. u/crustation_nation explained, ""I'm gen z and that's exactly how it was when we came back to school from covid. No one was raising their hands, everyone was just quiet."" They remembered answering every teacher’s question just to break the silence. ""Something about this behavior feels so deeply selfish because of the discomfort it causes others.""Teachers, managers, and service workers shared similar frustrations. A community college instructor said even simple icebreaker games failed. Students struggled to find common ground and spoke so softly that responses had to be repeated. A waitress added, ""There's definitely a non-insignificant percentage of Gen Z (and going into Gen Alpha as well) that thinks barely whisper-talking while looking away from you is a great way to communicate."" @guyfieriwhore um...... #foryou #fyp #xybca #college #friends ♬ original sound - mandy Social cues, silence, and influencer cultureThese accounts painted a consistent picture: younger people often whisper, mumble, or refuse eye contact. Several adults noted that requests to ""speak up"" only made the issue worse. A factory worker explained they stopped talking to younger employees altogether because communication felt impossible in a loud environment.Commenters also pointed to deeper causes. One high school teacher noticed students covered their mouths while talking, even when asked to stop. Another Redditor blamed influencer culture, saying younger generations act like they always have a personal ""brand."" This constant self-awareness may intensify the fear of appearing ""cringe.""Poet and NYU professor Ocean Vuong explained this cultural shift in an interview with ABC News. ""They perform cynicism because cynicism can be misread, as it often is, as intelligence. I think sincerity is something we deeply hunger for, particularly young people, but we are embarrassed when sincerity is in the room.""Meanwhile, older coworkers and classmates described the silence as selfish or arrogant. A millennial nontraditional student complained that group projects with Gen Z peers felt like ""pulling teeth."" A manager admitted they dreaded small talk with younger employees because the responses always felt forced and uncomfortable.Taken together, the conversation suggested that what looks like rudeness may actually stem from insecurity and pandemic isolation.@guyfieriwhore did not respond immediately to the Daily Dot’s request for comment via TikTok DM.The internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Unicef, Ang INK join hands for Hiraya cards	Unicef Philippines, in collaboration with Ang Ilustrador ng Kabataan (Ang INK), launches the Hiraya Collection, a new line of all-occasion cards and merchandise that aims to bring hope to vulnerable children through beautiful, art-filled gifts.The limited-edition collection features unique designs by Ang INK, a collective of children’s illustrators. Hiraya is a Filipino term that signifies deep hope and aspiration and the collection paints an image of a happy childhood every child deserves to experience.Each collectible design is inspired by Ang INK artists’ fondest childhood memories, turning every item into a meaningful gift that connects, celebrates, and gives hope.Iori Espiritu, a ceramic artist and illustrator, designed the “Sama-Sama, Salo-Salo,” which shows children gathering ingredients for a meal, reflecting her hope for children to have proper nutrition or to have access to healthy food.Kat Melo, designer and illustrator, draws from her own childhood memories with her piece called “Sayaw ng Santan.” It captures a moment of playfulness and carefreeness she remembers, weaving together images of children dancing and making bracelets from flowers.Al Estrella, a full-time grade school teacher and an illustrator, chose the subject of education, titling his piece “Pangalawang Tahanan” or “Second Home.” He believes that learning can happen inside and outside the school and that classrooms are children’s second home.In 2024, thanks to generous contributions of supporters, Unicef provided over 26,000 children with emergency supplies after landslides and floods.The Hiraya Collection includes the Unicef Cards for Every Occasion, featuring 12 unique designs. The collection also consists of the Unicef Tote Bag, which comes with a keychain and is available in three different designs for P1,500.Every purchase from the Hiraya Collection supports Unicef’s programs for children in education, health and nutrition, immunization, protection, climate, environment, resilience, and aid in emergencies.The collection is available exclusively on the Unicef Giving Shop (donate.unicef.ph/shop).	manilatimes	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/09/07/the-sunday-times/arts-awake/unicef-ang-ink-join-hands-for-hiraya-cards/2180181	2025-09-06 16:01:00

Five things people now remember about Marcos Jr.	EACH Philippine president and his or her presidency leave an indelible mark on the Filipino consciousness that outlives his or her term of office. Memories of that term can harden into myths, sometimes unfairly maligning him or her despite evidence to the contrary. Ultimately, however, history judges a presidency not by facts and figures, but by the lasting impressions passed on by ordinary people to the next generation.This is why I worry that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s presidency may one day be remembered for only five things.First, the high cost of living during his administration, with prices of rice, fuel and everyday necessities rising frequently. Second, the arrest of his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte and transport to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity. Third, the massive floods that swallowed entire neighborhoods in Metro Manila, Bulacan and other parts of the country. Fourth, the large-scale corruption in flood control projects involving officials from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), politicians and contractors. And fifth, the horrendous traffic and vehicular accidents that have killed and injured hundreds.Despite his administration’s manifold accomplishments, President Marcos’ first three years in office have been overshadowed by these five ill-defining impressions. Filipinos were swept up by these crises and controversies, struggling to see any meaningful achievements tied to his eight-point socioeconomic agenda. Do you still recall them?It doesn’t augur well that President Marcos frequently loses the narrative while events unfold and seemingly overwhelm his administration. Even his much-publicized anticorruption campaign targeting the multibillion-peso DPWH flood control projects may have backfired and hurt his administration. By exposing the anomalies, he inadvertently revealed the complicity of his relatives and close allies in Congress. The opposition now smells blood, and the public demands accountability. A prolonged legislative investigation risks unearthing deeper scandals that could trigger mass unrest and lead to an Indonesian-style upheaval.In fact, the midterm “resignations” of top officials in environment, housing, public works, communications, the Philippine National Police and the National Bureau of Investigation do not bode well for investor confidence, which sees his government as unsteady and lacking continuity. It also reflects the President’s poor judgment in appointing unfit people to these critical offices. This is a far cry from his father’s respected Cabinet, which was composed of the brightest technocrats in our era, like Cesar Virata, Roberto Ongpin, Gerardo Sicat, Onofre Corpuz and Jaime Laya.Still, President Marcos has three years left in his term to regain the momentum for his “Bagong Pilipinas” (New Philippines) campaign. The task is daunting, but not impossible. He must assert control over Congress and put an end to these self-serving investigations into the DPWH anomalies. He must direct all prosecuting agencies to file charges against the suspects and promptly put them behind bars, similar to what happened after the pork barrel scam of businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles exploded. The 2026 national budget must be airtight and pork barrel-proof to restore the public trust. Likewise, he must confront the resurgence of crimes like rape, illegal drugs, theft, robbery, murder and digital scams before another crime wave hits his administration. And most crucially, he must rein in the greed of his relatives, friends, campaign donors and political allies that are fueling people’s discontent and disillusionment.If he fails to face and resolve these, then history may indeed reduce his presidency to those five unfortunate memories. His supporters will argue this is unfair. After all, Marcos has been steadfast in defending Philippine sovereignty against Chinese aggression, earning praise here and abroad. The country’s macroeconomic fundamentals have remained stable despite global headwinds like regional conflicts and supply chain disruptions. And his departure from the Duterte administration’s bloody drug war and human rights violations has earned respect even among his fiercest critics.Yet, after three years, what most Filipinos remember are five things: high prices, Duterte’s arrest and transfer, catastrophic floods, rampant corruption, and paralyzing traffic and transportation mess. Fair or not, these adverse impressions threaten to eclipse his broader vision and major achievements as he exits in June 2028.But all is not yet lost. Three years is fast for a transactional and reactive presidency, but it is still long for a transformative and decisive leader. Many Filipinos like myself are fond of underdogs and are now rooting for Marcos, praying that he finds the strength to recover above the disarray, silence his naysayers, and secure his rightful place in the annals of history as one of our greatest presidents.	manilatimes	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/09/07/opinion/columns/five-things-people-now-remember-about-marcos-jr/2180131	2025-09-06 16:01:00
PHLPost: A strategy lesson in governance	IN a directors’ training program I recently attended, the Philippine Postal Corp. (PHLPost) was presented as a case study. We were tasked with analyzing its performance and proposing solutions. The exercise revealed a company at a crossroads: declining revenues, persistent operating losses, and growing reliance on subsidies and other non-operating income. This is not inherently wrong, but it is risky if it substitutes for much-needed operational transformation.PHLPost is a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) that carries the universal service obligation to deliver mail nationwide, including to remote areas that private couriers often avoid. Yet its mission to serve all Filipinos has not been matched with a vision and strategy that secure its relevance in a digital economy. This misalignment makes the organization appear stuck in the past, unable to redefine its role for the future.From a strategy lens, the gaps become clearer. Using the Balanced Scorecard, we saw weaknesses across multiple perspectives. Financially, revenues have been shrinking year after year. From the customer perspective, PHLPost has lost ground to private couriers who are faster, more flexible, and digitally enabled. Internally, the organization has struggled to modernize its processes. In terms of learning and growth, its workforce lacks the tools and incentives to drive innovation. These weaknesses collectively erode performance and risk further diminishing citizen trust in the government’s capacity to deliver.Execution barriers compound the problem. There is a vision barrier, as the organization has not clearly articulated how it will remain relevant in a digital economy. There is a resource barrier, as it depends heavily on government subsidies. There is a people barrier, with employees often constrained by outdated systems. And there is a management barrier, where compliance tends to dominate over strategy. These barriers make it difficult for PHLPost to turn plans into performance.Culture plays a role as well. PHLPost’s official core values include commitment, innovation, teamwork, entrepreneurial spirit, patriotism, integrity, excellence, and spirituality. While these are noble and comprehensive, the challenge lies in living them out consistently. Values risk remaining words on a wall rather than drivers of transformation.Our group discussions explored possible solutions. Revenue diversification was a priority, shifting from declining mail services to parcel delivery and e-commerce logistics. Asset optimization was another, by leveraging PHLPost’s valuable real estate portfolio for income generation and partnerships. We also stressed digital transformation to bring its services in line with customer expectations for tracking, payments, and online access. Efficiency reforms such as consolidating underutilized post offices and streamlining routes were suggested as well. One practical idea was to adopt the model of private courier services by accrediting third-party riders. This would expand PHLPost’s reach and keep costs competitive while supplementing, not replacing, its workforce.While contexts differ, countries like Singapore Post and Japan Post illustrate how postal systems can reinvent themselves when governance and strategy align. Singapore Post pivoted toward e-commerce logistics, while Japan Post expanded into financial and insurance services. These examples show that transformation is possible when boards actively steer organizations toward future relevance.The PHLPost case also reminded me of the Tricker Model of Governance, which distinguishes between conformance and performance. PHLPost’s board has leaned heavily toward conformance, ensuring processes, compliance, and stakeholder reporting. It has been weaker on performance, where strategy and long-term viability should reside. This raises an important challenge for the board: How can it pivot from compliance oversight to strategic stewardship that reimagines PHLPost’s future? The responsibility for strategy cannot rest solely with management. Boards are duty-bound to look outward and forward, ensuring sustainability and relevance.The lesson for directors is clear. Governance must go beyond checklists and awards. A well-structured board and transparent reports mean little if the organization cannot sustain itself, innovate, and serve its mandate. Strategy is not about incremental improvements but about positioning for the future. For public institutions like PHLPost, this means reconnecting vision, mission, and values to a strategy that delivers outcomes citizens can actually feel. As future directors, we must ensure governance frameworks do not stop at compliance but push organizations to reimagine their relevance and resilience.	manilatimes	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/09/07/business/sunday-business-it/phlpost-a-strategy-lesson-in-governance/2180091	2025-09-06 16:01:00
The constitutional guarantee against imprisonment for debt	Dear PAO,Last year, my father obtained a personal loan amounting to Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (P300,000.00) from a known loan shark. Because he was unexpectedly laid off from work, he was unable to pay the loan when it fell due. Yesterday, two (2) individuals who introduced themselves as law enforcement officers went to our residence and demanded that my father accompany them to the police station. Naturally, he refused, and shortly thereafter, he began receiving a series of text messages containing threats, including a claim that a warrant for his arrest had just been issued and will soon be enforced on account of his failure to settle his debt. Terrified at the thought of being suddenly arrested, my father now refuses to leave the house, let alone go to the police station to report the threats. I just want to know if he can really be arrested and imprisoned for his failure to pay his debt. Thank you.SamDear Sam,Article III, Section 20 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution explicitly provides that “[n]o person shall be imprisoned for debt or nonpayment of a poll tax.” The guarantee of immunity from imprisonment to a person who shall fail to pay his/her debt was “brought about by the force of public opinion which looked with abhorrence on statutory provision which permitted the cruel imprisonment of debtors. The people sought to prevent the use of the power of the State to coerce the payment of debts. The control of the creditor over the person of his debtor was abolished by human statutory and constitutional provisions.” (George H. Ganaway vs. J. W. Quillen, GR 18619, Feb. 20, 1922, Ponente: Associate Justice George Malcolm).In the Quillen case, the Supreme Court shed light on the scope of the constitutional guarantee, essentially limiting its application to civil actions, the object and sole purpose of which is collection of debts. This means that the State is not precluded from prosecuting cases of debt incurred through fraudulent means, i.e., estafa, which remain punishable by imprisonment in our jurisdiction.In your father’s case, the constitutional guarantee against imprisonment for debt renders it highly unlikely, if not impossible, for him to be arrested and imprisoned on account of his mere failure to settle his debt. At most, the only recourse available to the creditor would be the filing of a civil case for collection of sum of money, specifically a small claims case, against your father, following the Rules on Expedited Procedures in the First Level Courts (a.m. 08-8-7-SC dated 1 March 2022), which provides:“RULE I“APPLICABILITY“Section 1. Coverage. – These Rules shall govern the expedited procedures in the Metropolitan Trial Courts (MeTCs), the Municipal Trial Courts in Cities (MTCCs), the Municipal Trial Courts (MTCs) and the Municipal Circuit Trial Courts (MCTCs), for the following cases falling within their jurisdiction: A. CIVIL CASES (1) Summary Procedure Cases, as follows: xxx (2) Small Claims Cases, as defined hereunder, where the claim does not exceed One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00), exclusive of interest and costs.“A ‘small claim’ is an action that is purely civil in nature where the claim or relief raised by the plaintiff is solely for the payment or reimbursement of a sum of money. It excludes actions seeking other claims or reliefs aside from payment or reimbursement of a sum of money and those coupled with provisional remedies.”Consequently, the claim that a warrant for your father’s arrest had been issued is, for all intents and purposes, a sham that should not be given any regard.We hope that we are able to answer your queries. This advice is based solely on the facts you have narrated and our appreciation of the same. Our opinion may vary when other facts are changed or elaborated.We appreciate your trust and support.Editor’s note: Dear PAO is a daily column of the Public Attorney’s Office.

Dr Michelle Dickinson: nanotechnologist on the new study revealing eggs don't scramble cholesterol	For years, eggs have been breakfast’s most controversial ingredient. Despite being packed with protein and essential nutrients, they’ve carried the weight of dietary guidelines that linked them to high cholesterol and an increased risk of heart disease. But a new study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition has cracked that myth wide open. The world-first study investigated the independent effects of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat on LDL cholesterol levels. The results: it’s not the cholesterol in eggs that’s the problem, it’s the saturated fat in other parts of our diet, like bacon and sausages. In this controlled trial, researchers assigned participants to diets with varying combinations of cholesterol and saturated fat. In one group, participants consumed two eggs per day as part of a high-cholesterol but low-saturated-fat diet. In another, participants ate high-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol meals. A third group consumed both high saturated fat and high cholesterol. What they found was surprising: LDL cholesterol only rose in diets high in saturated fat regardless of dietary cholesterol intake. But when cholesterol came from eggs in the absence of excess saturated fat, LDL levels actually dropped slightly. This is an important finding because it challenges long-held assumptions in nutritional science. For decades, dietary cholesterol (often from eggs) was lumped in with saturated fats as a heart health hazard. But as this study demonstrates, the two have very different effects on the body. Eggs contain around 186 mg of cholesterol per yolk, which historically raised alarms. However, they are very low in saturated fat (about 1.6 grams per large egg). Saturated fats found in processed meats, butter, and fried foods are the true drivers of increased LDL cholesterol, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. The study reaffirms a growing body of evidence that dietary cholesterol has minimal impact on blood cholesterol in most people, especially when consumed as part of a healthy, balanced diet. The key takeaway isn’t just that eggs are safe, it’s that context matters. A couple of eggs at breakfast is fine. A couple of eggs alongside bacon, sausages, and buttered toast? Not so much. It’s the overall pattern of your diet, not individual foods, that makes the biggest difference to your heart health. So feel free to enjoy your poached, scrambled, or sunny-side-up eggs. Just remember: it’s the saturated fat, not the eggs, that’s more likely to scramble your cholesterol.LISTEN ABOVE	newstalkzb	https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/the-sunday-session/audio/dr-michelle-dickinson-nanotechnologist-on-the-new-study-revealing-eggs-dont-scramble-cholesterol/	2025-09-06 23:42:32

'We're going to flood the zone': Trump officials plot at event 'filled with extremists'	The Guardian reports the Friday National Conservatism Conference in Washington, D.C. hosted a wide variety of far-right religious extremists, from men-only secret societies to theocratic right-wing pundits and associations.Other event speakers were closely associated with the secretive Society for American Civic Renewal (SACR), an invitation-only, Christian ultra-nationalist network with “undercurrents of neo-fascist accelerationism,” according to a Middlebury Institute report.Mingling and mixing among the theocrats, however, were Trump officials.READ MORE: 'Whiplash': Insider says Trump 'knows where things stand' — and it’s killing him“NatCon is filled with extremists touting white nationalism and conspiracy theories,” said Heidi Beirich, the chief strategy officer and co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “What is notable is how Trump administration officials and allies are key players in the event, showing that it is near impossible today to distinguish the far right from the administration.”One speech by White house “border czar” Tom Homan contained warnings for the city of Chicago, which Trump is threatening to douse with federal agents and national guard troops, as he already has in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.“I said two months ago, we’re going to flood the zone and that’s exactly what we’re doing,” Homan told the crowd. “In Chicago, it’s coming. So, watch what happens in the very near future.”The Guardian reports Trump’s deputy attorney general, Harmeet Dhillon, gave her own speech in which she characterized the justice department’s civil rights division as “the president’s shock troops.”READ MORE: Trump discovers rejection on the world stage — because of his 'weak mind': analysis“We’re the front guard. We are going to go first and clear the way for others to do their work,” said Dhillon, who has assigned civil rights lawyers to investigate anti-genocide campus protests and perceived “anti-Christian bias.”Other administration figures speaking at NatCon included Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and Small Business Administration leader and former senator, Kelly Loeffler.These Trump officials shared screen time with leading figures of the so-called “new right,” an anti-democratic and ultra-nationalist far-right movement “whose reactionary views have undergirded the Trump administration’s actions,” according to the Guardian.

Today's Wordle Hint, Answers for #1542 on Monday, September 8, 2025	Today's Wordle Hint, Answers for #1542 on Monday, September 8, 2025	capjournal	https://www.capjournal.com/arena/lifestyle_entertainment/todays-wordle-hint-answers-for-1542-on-monday-september-8-2025/article_29e0cf00-5a41-55ea-88a0-6b77fc2ad8e6.html	2025-09-08 04:04:00
Middle East M&A Volume Climbs Amid Global Decline	Deal volumes across the Middle East hit 271 in the first half of 2025, up from 228 a year earlier, defying a 9 per cent contraction in global M&A activity. The region owes this strong performance to sovereign capital, regulatory reforms, and strategic investments in high-growth sectors. Middle East M&A Volume Climbs Amid Global Decline now captures the robust upswing.Driving this growth are the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which together accounted for 89 per cent of all regional deals, contributing 240 of the total 271 transactions. Egypt posted the most dramatic year-on-year increase, Saudi Arabia held firm, and the UAE maintained its dominance as a key investment hub. These three markets continue to anchor regional momentum with consistent activity. Deal dynamics reveal a marked tilt toward mid-market transactions. About 96 per cent of disclosed deals were valued under USD 100 million, and no megadeals—those above USD 5 billion—were recorded for the second consecutive half-year. Investors clearly favour less capital-intensive, faster-closing acquisitions aligned with national economic goals. Sovereign wealth funds are pivotal in sustaining this resilience. Investors such as Abu Dhabi’s ADQ channelled up to 85 per cent of funds into domestic projects, reinforcing economic diversification and localisation drives. Corporate buyers led 154 deals, while private equity maintained strong representation with 117 deals, underscoring balanced market participation. Thematic trends highlight technology, energy transition, and healthcare as key catalysts. Landmark transactions include G42’s USD 2.2 billion acquisition of a 40 per cent stake in Khazna Data Centers, and Saudi Arabia’s USD 907 million Elm Co acquisition of Thiqah Business Services—both reflecting long-term strategic priorities. Intra-regional and domestic deal flow gained traction, with 134 transactions recorded, up from 118 in H1 2024, while outbound cross-border deals continued to wane. This signals increasing investor confidence in local markets and a pivot to regionally self-sufficient economic strategies. Each country brings distinct strengths: the UAE, with 95 deals, remains the most active hub, thanks to its flexible regulatory environment and sector diversity; Saudi Arabia, with 59 deals, benefits from Vision 2030 reforms and steady non-oil growth; and Egypt, surging to 86 deals, is boosted by IMF support, tax modernisation and renewed investor trust. Globally, M&A volumes declined by 9 per cent in H1 2025—a stark contrast to the Middle East’s 19 per cent rise. The gulf underscores the region’s adaptive capacity and alignment with broader economic transformation goals.The post Middle East M&A Volume Climbs Amid Global Decline appeared first on Arabian Post.	thearabianpost	https://thearabianpost.com/middle-east-ma-volume-climbs-amid-global-decline/	2025-09-08 04:04:00

GCC Banks Post Record-High Quarterly Profits	Net profits for banks listed across the Gulf Cooperation Council surged to an unprecedented $16.6 billion in the second quarter, marking the second straight quarter of gains and a sequential increase of roughly 3.7 %, with year-on-year growth at a robust 9.2 %, according to Kamco Invest. This performance was driven by broadly higher revenues and a lower cost-to-income ratio that more than compensated for a rise in impairments. Lending activity remained resilient, underpinned by strong economic fundamentals and a pipeline of projects in the region.Banks across the GCC achieved strong growth, with net profits rising 10.3 % year-on-year to $16.6 billion in Q2 2025, according to the latest Kamco Invest analysis. The sequential increase of about 3.7 % was fuelled by a broad-based rise in revenues, while a leaner cost-to-income ratio offset the impact of elevated impairments. Lending growth persisted, reflecting healthy demand and continued economic momentum.Abu Dhabi led regional outperformers as its banks posted aggregate Q2 earnings of $3.2 billion—a 23.1 % rise compared to the year before. First Abu Dhabi Bank stood out with a 29.4 % surge in quarterly net profits to $1.5 billion, supported by stronger non-interest income and lower impairment charges. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank also delivered solid gains, buoyed by elevated interest and fee income.Dubai’s banks, by contrast, experienced a contraction: aggregate city-listed earnings fell by 6.4 % to $3.2 billion, weighed down by increased impairments at major lenders such as Emirates NBD. Some resilience came from Commercial Bank of Dubai, which posted a 15.4 % rise, alongside a surge in real-estate and utilities profits—Emaar Properties and DEWA among the top performers.Among other GCC markets, Q2 net profits for Oman-listed banks were around $1 billion, while those in Qatar also posted gains, contributing to the overall strength in the banking sector.The headline figure—$16.6 billion in quarterly profit for GCC banks—captures the scale of the region’s banking sector resilience. This strong performance highlights how GCC banks post record-high quarterly profits, powered by sustained credit growth and operational efficiencies even amid higher impairments.--The post GCC Banks Post Record-High Quarterly Profits appeared first on Arabian Post.	thearabianpost	https://thearabianpost.com/gcc-banks-post-record-high-quarterly-profits/	2025-09-08 04:04:00

Amata’s IGIA message focused on local economic growth and inclusion in key Federal programs	Source: Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata’s D.C. staffWashington, D.C. — Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata gave remarks Thursday at the Interagency Group on Insular Affairs (IGIA), a special mid-year session hosted by the Department of the Interior (DOI) at their DC headquarters, and focused her remarks on several issues that are critical to the local economy of American Samoa, and called for full inclusion in federal programs like SSI and removing the Medicaid cap completely.Congresswoman Amata thanked Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolao Pula, the governors and congressional representatives from the other territories, and federal interagency officials. Discussing economic issues, she thanked the administration for the April 17 Executive Order reopening fishing in the PRIMNM, which will bolster American Samoa’s economic stability, and strengthen U.S. food security.“While certain groups are attempting to litigate and delay the executive order, I am confident that we will be able to finalize the restoration of our fishing access in a responsible and successful way. I hope to continue to work with you on this and other issues affecting the Pacific,” she said.Congresswoman Amata filed in the comment period in July regarding the seabed mining lease, and continues urging the Bureau of Ocean Energy and Management (BOEM) to at minimum maintain a strict 50-mile distance buffer from any Samoan island.“In addition to managing our natural resources, another key part of the equation for our prosperity lies in being able to participate in the coming knowledge economy of the 21st century. The best way for DOI and the administration to support American Samoa’s participation in the growth of the economy is through measures that protect our cannery and invest in our ability to attract other industries,” she said.She went on to request support for her bill, H.R. 399, to reauthorize Section 30A of the tax code, commonly known as the American Samoa Economic Development Credit, which expired in 2022, to increase the potential to diversify the local economy. “There is strong bipartisan support for its reauthorization, and we remain hopeful it can be included in another legislative vehicle. It's also important to note that the cost of this credit is relatively minimal (just $8.5 million per year) yet its impact on the territory is profound,” she continued. “Renewal of this credit is vital for businesses operating in a remote island territory, where logistical hurdles and limited infrastructure create unique economic challenges.”Amata thanked Interior leadership for being supportive of her calls for a permanent Coast Guard presence in and around American Samoa, noting their role in the security concerns of the Pacific region.“Mr. Secretary, as we’ve heard from our governors today, initiatives which invest in and protect the economic and security interests of the otherwise isolated territories are important to keep us on par with the rest of the country,” she said in closing. “To that end, SSI shouldn’t be based on geography, and Medicaid should be uncapped for the territories, like the states. So, I ask that you work with us to ensure full integration into these essential programs are provided to all Americans. This mid-year forum shows the administration’s commitment to uplifting the territories along with the rest of the country, and I am optimistic about the future.”Section: Local NewsTags: Congresswoman Uifa’atali AmataView the discussion thread.	samoanews	https://samoanews.com/local-news/amatas-igia-message-focused-local-economic-growth-and-inclusion-key-federal-programs	2025-09-08 17:46:48

Mumbai-Delhi Air India Flight Makes Safe Second Attempt After Go-Around	"An Air India flight from Mumbai to Delhi on Monday performed a go-around after an initial aborted landing but safely touched down on its second attempt, an official stated. ""Flight AI2910 operating from Mumbai to Delhi on 8 September, discontinued with landing and performed a routine go around at Delhi as per standard protocols. The aircraft landed safely in its second attempt, and all passengers and crew have disembarked. At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remains top priority,"" An Air India Express Spokesperson said in a statement. Earlier on Friday, Air India Express flight 1028, which was operating from Delhi to Indore, made a priority landing at Indore Airport after the pilot detected a technical snag, an Air India spokesperson confirmed. On Sunday, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson wrote letters to employees, highlighting the airline's progress in performance, customer experience, and network growth, while reaffirming the company's commitment to transparency and cultural transformation. ""Like all airlines, we faced a variety of operational scenarios--some of which were under our control, and some that were not,"" the CEO wrote, referring to the crisis the airline faced following the AI171 plane crash in Ahmedabad earlier this year. ""When the spotlight was on us, it was crucial to offer timely, clear and accurate information and the right context,"" he wrote in the letters disseminated via e-mail. He acknowledged that Air India had deliberately been ""more transparent than usual in reporting incidents and events, however small."" While this had temporarily increased news coverage, he emphasised that in the context of Air India's scale and size, the incidence rate was ""entirely normal."" ""This transparency will, over time, help build trust. In the short term, though, it naturally resulted in an uptick of news coverage, and with more than 1,200 departures every single day--nearly one every minute--across the Air India Group, it could seem like a lot. In context of our scale and size, however, the incidence rate was entirely normal."" (This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

NFC Award	EDITORIAL: The meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC) constituted by the President has been deferred on the request of Sindh on some legitimate grounds: grappling with the ongoing devastation caused by the continuing monsoon spells as well as the release of flood waters from India, the upper riparian country. There is, however, intense speculation that under consideration is a constitutional amendment that would allow for a downward revision in the share of the provinces from the formula agreed in the 2010 NFC award that (i) increased the share of the provinces to 56 percent of the divisible pool, leaving 44 percent share for the federal government (ii) as well as a reduction of the weight given to population to 82 percent, a reduction agreed by the affected Punjab that, reports suggested, was linked to the 18th Constitutional Amendment lifting the ban on a third-time prime minister.Be that as it may, the argument that the federal government requires additional funds from the divisible pool as its capacity to meet other than defence and debt servicing from its annual resources is severely compromised. Two observations are in order. First, till the devolution of subjects to provinces and the attainment of one percentage increase in tax to GDP ratio every year for five years by the Federal Board of Revenue as envisaged in the seventh NFC award (that remains disturbingly under 10 percent) provinces were required to give an agreed surplus to the federal government. Today that amount is a whopping 1,464 billion rupees. And second, the petroleum levy on sale of petroleum and its products, which essentially is another name for sales tax, which should be credited to the divisible pool, is budgeted under other taxes rendering it ineligible for the divisible pool. The envisaged revenue from this is 1,468 billion rupees in the current year. Or, in total the amount is around 3 trillion rupees additional budgeted resources in the current year that were not available to the Centre prior to the seventh NFC Award.This additional revenue for the Centre if factored into the math would provide the following scenario: (i) total budgeted FBR taxes for the current year are 14,131 billion rupees with the provincial share at 7,988.5 billion rupees (minus straight transfers) with the remaining 6,142 billion rupees earmarked for the federal government; and (ii) total 3 trillion rupees under the post-seventh NFC Award added to the Centre’s 6,142 billion rupees gives a total of 9 trillion rupees which, if added to the FBR total collections, gives the federal government a share at 53 percent — 9 percent more than the 44 percent agreed.It is important to note that the clamour that the Centre requires a higher share of the NFC Award persists though it is unclear whether the post-7th NFC additions to the Centre would be taken into account. It is hoped that any constitutional amendment that pertains to the NFC Award must take account of three factors. First and foremost, the federal and provincial governments must adhere to the letter and spirit of what was agreed with the IMF; notably, “on September 30, 2024, the federal government and all provincial governments signed the National Fiscal Pact (which) is an ambitious effort to rebalance spending responsibilities and better align provincial and federal taxation policies. Provinces agreed to the devolution of specific expenditures from the federal to provincial governments in line with the 18th Constitutional Amendment. Provinces have also committed to enhancing tax collection, and implementation efforts are underway. ...The federal government’s rightsizing exercise is progressing. ...Ambitions over the extent of streamlining under the federal government’s rightsizing efforts, however, may need to increase so that they (as outlined in the National Fiscal Pact) correspond to the extent of the reallocation of expenditure mandates under the 18th Constitutional Amendment.”Second; the amendment must include the division of responsibilities and resources between the provinces and the local governments to ensure meaningful devolution. And finally, the Centre needs to undertake measures to slash its own current expenditure that on average rises between 15 to 20 percent each year that must entail slashing the elite capture of resources (raising salaries of 7 percent of those paid salaries at the taxpayers’ expense while the rest of the working public struggles to make ends meet) as well as ushering reforms particularly in the pension system.Copyright Business Recorder, 2025	brecorder	https://www.brecorder.com/news/40383319/nfc-award	2025-09-18 01:32:09

Prompted by NCLA’s Suit, State Dep’t Comes Clean and Ends Scheme that Censored American Media	"The Daily Wire, The Federalist, State of Texas v. Department of State, et al.Washington, DC, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The U.S. State Department is officially dismantling the remaining aspects of its former Global Engagement Center used to finance the development and promotion of censorship technology and enterprises that blacklisted domestic news organizations. Acting Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Darren Beattie announced this development to The Daily Wire. His statements further confirm that the claims made in the New Civil Liberties Alliance’s Complaint about the GEC censorship apparatus at issue in The Daily Wire, The Federalist, Texas v. State Dep’t lawsuit were correct.Congress declined to renew the GEC’s funding in late 2024, but the Biden Administration sidestepped this legislative decision by reallocating its activities to another entity within the State Department and renaming it the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference framework. Representing The Daily Wire and The Federalist, NCLA applauds the State Department’s new admissions and its plans to eradicate related tools used to suppress so many members of the American press.Beattie told The Daily Wire yesterday that the former GEC framework ""devolved into tools for political censorship instead of protecting Americans from foreign adversarial propaganda,” its original stated purpose. As NCLA’s lawsuit contended, GEC was funding the development of ""mis” and ""disinformation” tools and technologies that had the intent and effect of suppressing Americans’ First Amendment protected speech.Secretary of State Marco Rubio first vindicated these claims in his April op-ed at The Federalist announcing plans to completely abolish the GEC. Underscoring evidence NCLA outlined in this case, Rubio decried the GEC’s financing the development and promotion of censorship technology and enterprises, such as NewsGuard and the Global Disinformation Index, that blacklisted domestic news organizations in order to demonetize them. NCLA’s suit helped expose how these companies targeted media outlets-including The Daily Wire and The Federalist-that opposed the government’s preferred narrative. The technologies these companies developed suppressed NCLA’s clients’ views by reducing their circulation and ultimately depriving them of advertising dollars.Beattie admitted that GEC frequently asked tech companies to censor people on their platforms, noting that ""a lot of the names that they submitted to tech companies weren’t even foreign.” He indicated that his office has now shut down the aspects of the GEC that remained after Rubio’s April announcement, including formal and informal agreements with foreign countries to ""facilitate and provide a framework for cooperation on mutual objectives, including principally combating so-called disinformation.” Beattie’s new revelations continue to prove correct the allegations of NCLA and its clients that the GEC exceeded its statutory mandate to combat foreign malign influence operations. NCLA looks forward to working with the Trump Administration and to using the information gleaned through discovery in this case to assist with developing measures that will ensure the State Department does not trample Americans’ First Amendment rights in the future.NCLA released the following statements:""We are glad to see our clients’ claims begin to be vindicated by the State Department’s latest statements. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. Even during litigation, the State Department shielded the truth with a protective order and claims of privilege. Today’s announcement is a good start.”- Zhonette Brown, General Counsel and Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA""It’s gratifying that the State Department is finally acknowledging publicly the informal coordination with foreign governments. For two years, we have been fighting for the State Department to halt this unconstitutional conduct.”- Margot Cleveland, Of Counsel, NCLA""As NCLA has claimed from the outset of this lawsuit, and this week’s news makes ever more certain, the U.S. State Department under President Biden and Secretary Blinken engaged in an unprecedented and unlawful crackdown on the domestic free speech of American media outlets and American citizens to support the government’s preferred narrative on a wide range of topics. Absent this lawsuit, brought by NCLA on behalf of The Daily Wire and The Federalist, this treacherous scheme may never have fully come to light.”- Mark Chenoweth, President, NCLAFor more information visit the case page here.ABOUT NCLANCLA is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights group founded by prominent legal scholar Philip Hamburger to protect constitutional freedoms from violations by the Administrative State.

Flooring Expert Roman Keim Shares Best Kitchen Flooring Options in HelloNation	"MOUNT VERNON, Ohio, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- What is the most durable flooring for a kitchen? That is a common question among homeowners planning a remodel, and flooring expert Roman Keim of Keim Flooring in Mount Vernon, Ohio, offers clear answers in HelloNation. Kitchens demand more from flooring than nearly any other room in the home. With constant traffic, frequent spills, and exposure to heat, flooring must be chosen with care to provide lasting function while supporting a home’s design. Keim points out that certain materials consistently stand out for their performance, style, and durability in this high-use space.Ceramic and porcelain tile remain reliable options for kitchen floors. These materials are designed to withstand heavy foot traffic, resist water damage, and endure the heat that often fills a cooking space. Their surfaces are easy to clean, and when spills occur, they can be wiped away without causing lasting harm. Tile also offers remarkable design flexibility, with countless sizes, colors, and finishes that allow homeowners to achieve both traditional and modern looks. For added comfort in colder regions, tile can even be paired with radiant heating systems, making it a practical yet versatile choice.Luxury vinyl plank, known as LVP, is another material that has grown in popularity for kitchens. It gives the appearance of hardwood or stone while offering resilience against moisture and scratches. Its layered construction makes it durable under heavy use, and its softer surface compared to tile provides comfort for those who spend long hours preparing meals. Keim notes that LVP does not warp or swell with water exposure, making it a dependable solution for busy households. Families with children and pets often find it an attractive option since it balances performance, affordability, and style.Sheet vinyl, while sometimes overlooked, also holds a place in kitchen flooring. Installed in large sheets, it reduces the number of seams where water could potentially seep through. This makes it highly effective against spills, which are inevitable in a kitchen environment. Sheet vinyl is also more forgiving underfoot than harder materials like tile, making it comfortable for extended standing. Modern designs have made sheet vinyl increasingly stylish, mimicking natural stone or wood while remaining one of the most budget-friendly options on the market.Hardwood flooring, while admired for its warmth and character, presents challenges in the kitchen. Natural wood is sensitive to moisture and can warp, stain, or swell over time. Even with protective sealants, wood floors in kitchens require greater care and maintenance compared to tile or vinyl. Engineered hardwood offers some advantages, with a protective top layer that provides more stability than solid wood. While it can handle humidity shifts better, it still does not match the resilience of tile or vinyl in moisture-prone spaces. Keim advises that homeowners choosing wood in the kitchen must be prepared for ongoing upkeep.Another material that brings unique benefits is cork. As a renewable resource, cork appeals to those interested in eco-friendly solutions. It is naturally softer than tile or wood, which reduces strain on feet and legs during long hours of cooking. Cork also has insulating properties that contribute to comfort. However, it requires sealing to protect against water damage, and heavy furniture can leave permanent marks. Homeowners drawn to cork must balance its warmth and sustainability with the maintenance it demands.When deciding among these options, homeowners should consider lifestyle, budget, and the specific needs of their household. For example, families with children or pets may find vinyl plank or sheet vinyl to be the most forgiving and cost-effective solutions. Those who want a high-end, long-lasting surface may lean toward porcelain tile, which provides unmatched durability. For homeowners focused on comfort, cushioned vinyl or cork may better suit their kitchen needs. Each option involves trade-offs, but all can deliver a balance of practicality and design when carefully matched to the way the kitchen is used.Maintenance is another key factor. Tile remains one of the most durable materials, but grout requires periodic cleaning and sealing. Vinyl products, by contrast, need little day-to-day care and can be easily maintained, though they do not carry the prestige of natural stone or wood. Hardwood can be refinished when scratched, but it demands more attention to avoid water-related damage. These differences underscore the importance of weighing not just appearance and cost, but also the level of upkeep a household is willing to manage.Keim emphasizes that the kitchen is the heart of the home, and the flooring plays a central role in its function and comfort. A good kitchen floor withstands moisture, tolerates heat, and holds up under heavy daily activity while still complementing the design of the space. Whether choosing tile, vinyl, cork, or engineered hardwood, the best option is one that aligns with both practical needs and long-term appeal.Best Flooring Options for the Kitchen is the article where Roman Keim of Keim Flooring in Mount Vernon, Ohio, outlines the strengths and trade-offs of tile, vinyl, hardwood, and cork for one of the busiest rooms in the home.About HelloNationHelloNation is a premier media platform that connects readers with trusted professionals and businesses across various industries.

John MacDonald: Nitrate emergency? Do me a favour	I wonder if the person who called me a tofu-eating, sandal-wearing, treehugger yesterday will have a bit of a re-think when they see what I’ve got to say about Environment Canterbury declaring a nitrate emergency. I’m with Federated Farmers, which is saying it’s nothing more than a political stunt. But it’s not just that, it’s a very naive political stunt. Because show me one of these so-called “emergency” declarations that have done any good. What about the Christchurch City Council’s climate emergency? Is that still a thing? Or have they quietly pulled the plug on that one? The other thing that makes ECan’s stunt particularly naive is that it’s the outfit still dishing out consents for more dairy farming in Canterbury. There are about 950,000 dairy cows in Canterbury and ECan is currently considering applications for another 10,000. I’ll come back to Federated Farmers because they’re not the only ones who aren’t happy about this emergency declaration – some ECan councillors themselves are brassed off, as well. So what happened yesterday is one of ECan’s outgoing councillors put forward the motion to declare the emergency and for ECan to “take a leadership role to urgently address the issue of groundwater pollution impacting drinking water sources and supplies”. Vicky Southworth is the councillor who put forward the motion at what was her very last ECan meeting. It was her last meeting, and it was the council’s last meeting before next month’s elections. The vote was close —9 in favour, 7 against— and some of the councillors who voted against it were pretty angry at yesterday’s meeting. Nick Ward is one of them. He said it was “grandstanding”. Another councillor, John Sunckell, said he’s spent 15 years trying to reduce nitrates, and “I just feel really pissed off with this little political stunt”. They both said nitrates levels are expected to decline over time and that rural communities had worked hard and collaboratively over decades to lower nitrates, and that “emergency” was the wrong word to use. Federated Farmers agrees. It’s slamming the move, with its vice-president Colin Hurst describing it as a “shameless political stunt that won’t help anyone”. If Councillor Southworth was so concerned about the nitrates, she wouldn’t be leaving. She’d be putting herself forward for re-election, just like outgoing chairperson Craig Pauling. He voted in favour of the nitrate emergency, but he’s moving on as well. Again, if he’s so worried about it, then he’d be trying to get elected again too. Instead, they can walk away feeling all virtuous, thinking they’ve done something positive and have made a difference. Do me a favour.	newstalkzb	https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/christchurch/canterbury-mornings-with-john-macdonald/opinion/john-macdonald-nitrate-emergency-do-me-a-favour/	2025-09-18 01:31:23

Karnataka: Brahmin Mahasabha demands removal of fake Brahmin Muslim and Christians from list of caste census	Bengaluru: The Karnataka government’s ambitious caste census, touted as a milestone exercise after nearly a century, has now run into severe opposition with the Brahmin community and opposition parties condemning what they call a “deliberate attempt to divide Hindus” under artificial sub-castes. In Gadag, members of the All Karnataka Brahmin Mahasabha launched both online and offline protests after discovering that the survey listed questionable sub-castes such as “Brahmin Christian” (S No. 209), “Brahmin Mujawar Muslim” (S No. 883), and “Vyas Brahmin Christian” (S No. 1384). According to them, such categories do not exist and are nothing but an attempt to mislead people and fragment Hindu society. “There are no Brahmin Muslims and no Brahmin Christians in our community. These entries are fake and must be removed immediately,” said Venkatesh Kulkarni, president of the Mahasabha’s Gadag district unit. “If the government does not drop these fabricated columns, we will launch a strong protest across the state.” Kulkarni and his associates submitted a memorandum to the Backward Classes Commission, insisting that classification must be done on the basis of economic criteria rather than concocted caste divisions. “People believe Brahmins are universally advanced, but the truth is many Brahmins remain poor and marginalized. We are losing equal opportunities due to such misrepresentations,” the memorandum stated. A political flashpoint The controversy has now spilled into state politics. Senior Congress leader and former minister RV Deshpande has written to Karnataka Backward Classes Commission chairman C.S. Madhusudan, warning that the survey risks scattering the true Brahmin population across multiple confusing sub-groups. For instance, the current survey lists Brahmin-related entries under several separate codes: 210 (Brahmin), 477 (Hoysala Karnataka), 802 (Madhwa Brahmin), 1216 (Smarta Brahmin), 1227 (Srivaishnava), 1228 (Srivaishnava Brahmin), and 209 (Brahmin Christian). “This classification not only distorts our demographic strength but also weakens our socio-economic representation,” said a community leader from Bengaluru. “We have been demanding a unified count as ‘Brahmins.’ Fragmenting us into dozens of sub-categories is nothing but an attempt to diminish our numbers and our rightful representation.” Sources estimate that there are 42 lakh Brahmins in Karnataka, including 15 lakh in Bengaluru alone. Traditionally, they have been divided into three major sects Smarta, Madhwa, and Srivaishnava. But community leaders allege that the census is arbitrarily expanding the list and thereby diluting their collective identity. Manufactured castes raise alarm The caste census has also added 107 new categories to the 1,400 castes already listed. Many of these names, critics say, have never appeared in any official list of any commission. Some of the controversial inclusions are Kuruba Christian, Madiwala Christian, and Vokkaliga Christian. The BJP has stepped into the issue, accusing the Congress government of deliberately inserting fabricated castes to encourage religious conversions and disrupt Hindu unity. A delegation of BJP leaders, including former minister Sunil Kumar, MP P.C. Mohan, state vice president Hartalu Halappa, opposition chief whip Doddanagouda Patil, and OBC Morcha president Raghu Kautilya, met the Backward Classes Commission chairman and demanded that the process be halted until the anomalies are corrected. “It is unacceptable to rush through a flawed survey during the Dussehra vacation. Surveying two crore households in 15 days is neither practical nor credible. This is nothing but political drama aimed at dividing Hindu communities,” said Sunil Kumar. The BJP has further warned that such arbitrary inclusion of “Christian versions” of Hindu castes could dangerously distort Karnataka’s social fabric. Census under cloud The socio-educational survey, popularly referred to as the caste census, is being conducted after 95 years in Karnataka. While the government claims it is aimed at better social justice and welfare planning, critics argue that its present form is an ill-conceived exercise that risks deepening divisions among Hindus rather than ensuring equity. Community representatives insist that classification should not treat an entire caste as backward or forward, but rather assess individuals and families on the basis of economic conditions. They argue that the government’s current approach is unscientific, misleading, and unconstitutional. “As per Article 15(4), an entire caste cannot be treated as backward. The census should focus on actual socio-economic status, not on imaginary caste divisions,” said Kulkarni.	organiser	https://organiser.org/2025/09/18/316427/bharat/karnataka-brahmin-mahasabha-demands-removal-of-fake-brahmin-muslim-and-christians-from-list-of-caste-census/	2025-09-18 01:30:28

Optimized for comfort during long workouts, the glasses are compatible with cycling helmets and hats, and are built to endure harsh elements with IP67 water and dust resistance, handling sun, snow and dirt with ease. The integration of Garmin and Strava gives athletes real-time personalized performance insights and with up to 9 hours of typical mixed-use battery life (plus an additional 36 hours via the charging case), Oakley Meta Vanguard is made to last through your entire marathon or century ride. And they’re designed with swappable Oakley PRIZM lenses, so you can customize your look and optimize for various lighting conditions. Pre-orders for Oakley Meta Vanguard are available today for 499$ (549 EUR) on Oakley.com and Meta.com. In addition, EssilorLuxottica and Meta unveiled the next generation of Ray-Ban Meta. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) comes with an extended battery life of up to 8 hours, an ultra-wide 12MP camera that now captures high-quality 3K ultra-HD videos with precision and clarity, and an expanded palette of styles and colors, all of which can be outfitted with individual prescription lenses, including Transitions Gen S lenses. Ray-Ban Meta continues to get better and more capable over time with regular updates and new features. At Connect, Meta revealed Conversation Focus, a new feature coming soon that uses AI glasses’ open-ear speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to, helping distinguish it from ambient background noise in cafes and restaurants, parks, and other busy places. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is available today starting at 379$ (419 EUR) on Ray-Ban.com and Meta.com. The most future-forward product to come from their collaboration is Meta Ray-Ban Display, which combines the world’s most popular AI glasses with an integrated display for the first time. The glasses feature a built-in, full-color visual display in the right lens that discreetly shows wearers incoming messages, previews of photos to capture, video calls, and visual AI information like step-by-step instructions. Customers can order Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses with their own unique prescription, and each pair comes fitted with Transitions lenses. The display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that enables you to control the glasses with subtle hand and finger movements. EssilorLuxottica’s decades of R&D in advanced lens technology paired with Meta’s hardware breakthroughs and leading AI capabilities provide a new window into the world in front of us. Meta Ray-Ban Display is available at select brick-and-mortar stores in the U.S. on September 30, starting at $799 USD, with expansion to Canada, France, Italy, and the UK planned for early 2026. “This latest innovation to come from our deep relationship with Meta reveals the next horizon. Having overcome the barriers to consumer adoption by fitting the most advanced tech into a beautiful pair of frames seamlessly and then delivering them to consumers through a global retail network, we set our sights on something bigger. Meta Ray-Ban Display showcases the best of our two companies in terms of our lens technology and wearables design expertise, and Meta’s leadership in AI and software architecture, and it completely redefines what it means to be ‘hands-free’. These, along with the next generation of Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, will take us all to new places and levels of performance in style. We’re incredibly proud to be pioneers with Meta in this space, with a long runway of innovation still ahead,” commented Francesco Milleri, Chairman and CEO at EssilorLuxottica. ""At Meta Connect, we’re introducing our most advanced lineup of AI glasses, designed for every lifestyle. This includes Meta Ray-Ban Display, our most impressive glasses yet, showcasing years of innovation in computer vision and AI. I’m proud of our partnership with EssilorLuxottica. Together, we’ve defined AI glasses as a new technology category and brought the first mainstream frames to the market. I believe glasses will be the ideal form factor to eventually deliver superintelligence, and I’m excited for what’s next,"" said Mark Zuckerberg, Founder and CEO of Meta.

LimeWire has bought the Fyre Festival name, outbidding Ryan Reynolds and shocking the internet	"LimeWire, the file-sharing giant that defined early 2000s internet piracy, is back in the headlines. This time, though, it’s not for music downloads or lawsuits.The company has confirmed that it officially bought the rights to Fyre Festival, the brand behind one of the most notorious event disasters of the last decade.The move comes after Fyre Festival’s founder, Billy McFarland, quietly put the brand up for sale on eBay earlier this year. The auction ended in July, with the name fetching $245,300.A bidding war that included Ryan ReynoldsAccording to LimeWire, the brand purchase wasn’t a simple one. Multiple parties were interested, including actor Ryan Reynolds and his marketing agency, Maximum Effort.In the end, LimeWire came out on top, announcing the win with a cheeky press release titled: “LimeWire Acquires Fyre Festival Brand — What Could Possibly Go Wrong?”Reynolds even issued a tongue-in-cheek statement: “Congrats to LimeWire for their winning bid for Fyre Fest. I look forward to attending their first event, but will be bringing my own palette of water.”What LimeWire says it plans to do with FyreSo why buy a brand that’s synonymous with disaster? LimeWire’s CEO Julian Zehetmayr says the plan isn’t to revive the Bahamas music festival that went down in flames in 2017. Instead, the idea is to reframe Fyre as a cultural icon that bridges internet meme history with “real-world experiences and community.”“We’re not bringing the festival back,” Zehetmayr explained. “We’re bringing the brand and the meme back to life. This time with real experiences, and without the cheese sandwiches.”For now, LimeWire hasn’t given any concrete details of what those experiences will look like.Social media users reactOn X, responses to the news included, ""Limewire? Haven't heard that name in years,"" and, ""Sorry, Limewire is still alive?!""https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1968361390214885445Under a post on Reddit’s r/music, commenters weren’t exactly empathetic to either brand. “The most surprising thing isn’t that someone bought Fyre Fest. It’s that LimeWire still exists and has the money to buy this,” one person wrote.Another joked, “Oh man, I can’t wait for the 7pm set of The Offspring with Dragonball Z fight scene super cuts on the background screens.”And one user summed it up: “Kind of apt, both would give you viruses if you’re not careful.”The internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Good news for tertiary education assistance, new impound facility | From the Mayor’s Desk	By Gunnedah Shire Council mayor Colleen Fuller I have plenty of good news to share this fortnight.

Flood-hit power consumers: Pakistan govt seeks IMF acquiescence to package	ISLAMABAD: The government has approached the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to seek approval for a special relief package in electricity bills for consumers affected by recent floods. The relief is expected to be formally announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in the coming days.On Wednesday, during a briefing to the National Assembly Standing Committee on Power, Secretary Power Dr Fakhray Alam Irfan stated that the IMF demands detailed information on every proposal before making a decision.In his televised address to the nation, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has already announced a waiver on electricity bills for flood-affected consumers for the month of August 2025. Surveys are currently under way to assess potential relief for commercial and industrial power users in the affected areas.August electricity bills waived for flood-hit areas: Awais Leghari“We have sought the IMF’s approval for relief in electricity bills for consumers impacted by the floods who are unable to pay,” said the Secretary. “An official announcement will be made in the next few days.”The Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC), a technical arm of the Power Division responsible for coordination with power distribution companies (Discos), has prepared and shared estimates of system and consumer losses for onward submission to the IMF.However, Secretary Power disagreed with a proposal by MNA Nauseen Iftikhar to allow vulnerable consumers to pay their bills in instalments. “If a consumer has an outstanding bill of Rs 30,000, it likely means they haven’t paid their bills for nearly a year,” he explained.He noted that there are a total of 33 million electricity consumers in the country, of which lifeline and protected consumers account for 180 million units of electricity consumption. These categories already receive government subsidies and are also being cross-subsidised by other consumers.In response to a question, the Secretary said that the IMF had allowed for power sector losses of Rs 640 billion in FY 2024-25, while actual losses were Rs 397 billion. He added that both the IMF and the Prime Minister have acknowledged improvements in the power sector’s performance. For FY 2025-26, the loss target has been set at Rs 540 billion.Regarding complaints of unscheduled load shedding from MNAs representing Sindh, the Secretary instructed Disco representatives to obtain Nepra’s approval for their load shedding plans. This, he said, would ensure that paying consumers continue to receive uninterrupted power supply. He also revealed that the recovery rates of both concerned Discos are 50 percent below target.MNAs clarified that their concerns were not with the CEOs or officials of the power companies, but with deficiencies in infrastructure that were causing unscheduled load shedding and other service issues.Secretary Power further stated that both Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) and Sukkur Electric Power Company (SEPCO) will be handed over to the private sector under long-term concessional agreements, though ownership will remain with the government. “In simple terms, both Discos will be ‘contracted out’ to the private sector, but the government will retain their ownership,” he clarified.A representative from HESCO informed the Committee that meters are being installed on transformers to ensure that electricity supply is disconnected only for consumers who either fail to pay their bills or are found involved in electricity theft. The Secretary, Power Division, apprised that HESCO and SEPCO had suffered losses of around Rs. 60 billion in one year due to non-recovery and technical issues. Other Members urged the Power Division and HESCO to focus on structural reforms rather than temporary measures. The Secretary, Power Division informed the Committee that HESCO had submitted an investment plan to NEPRA in November 2024. The plan aimed to strengthen feeders and improve the transmission system. The Committee directed that NEPRA be invited in the next meeting to clarify its position on the investment plan and related regulatory approvals. The Secretary, Power Division, suggested that the investment plan be reviewed and resubmitted to NEPRA so that its feedback on progress and shortcomings could be shared with the Committee in the next meeting. He further proposed that issues related to HESCO and SEPCO be addressed in a detailed meeting at his office once the floodwater situation improved, within 10–12 days, with participation of the concerned CEOs. If satisfactory progress was shown, the matter could be settled; otherwise, a clear report would be demanded. The Committee agreed with this suggestion and directed that the CEO, SEPCO, also be summoned in the next meeting.The Committee was briefed by the General Manager, PPMC (Power Planning & Monitoring Company), on postings and transfers of employees from GENCO, Jamshoro, to various DISCOs. It was also explained by Secretary, Power Division that about 3,000 employees were being accommodated based on domicile preferences where possible. However, grievances had arisen in cases where employees were posted far from their home regions or adjusted against lower-scale posts despite protection of their salary and grade. Some employees, including school staff, also faced difficulties in placement. Members stressed that errors in HR lists and reductions in scale against qualifications amounted to serious irregularities and demanded inquiries into such cases. The Committee emphasized that employees should, as far as possible, be adjusted within their home regions, and that proper mechanisms should be developed to address grievances. Syed Waseem Hussain, MNA raised concerns that employees were being posted in lower grades without due consideration of their qualifications and without being given any choice in postings. He further pointed out that both HESCO and SEPCO were facing staff shortages and suggested that authority for appointments be provided to them.The CEO, LESCO, also briefed the Committee. Rana Muhammad Hayat Khan, MNA, stressed that over-billing by LESCO must be eliminated. He further pointed out those projects such as feeders initiated two years ago remain incomplete, causing public frustration. While acknowledging the hard work of the CEO, he urged further improvements. He also highlighted that the recent floods had aggravated the situation by destroying major crops such as rice and sugarcane, which take months to mature. Although the Honourable Prime Minister had generously waived one month’s electricity bill, he proposed that at least six months’ bills be reduced by half, with the remaining half deferred for a year, to provide relief to farmers. He also called for interest-free loans and financial assistance for landlords to ensure agricultural stability and food security.The meeting was attended by Sheikh Aftab Ahmed, Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar, Rana Muhammad Hayat Khan, Muhammad Shaharyar Khan Mahar, Nauman Islam Shaikh, Syed Waseem Hussain, and Sanjay Perwani, MNAs. Senior officers from the Power Division, along with representatives from HESCO, SEPCO, PESCO, LESCO, IESCO, JPCL and PPMC, were also present.Copyright Business Recorder, 2025	brecorder	https://www.brecorder.com/news/40383360/flood-hit-power-consumers-pakistan-govt-seeks-imf-acquiescence-to-package	2025-09-18 01:29:29

Disappointed by Borderlands 4? Play the hidden gem of the series instead	Since the Borderlands movie's catastrophic failure, fans hoped Borderlands 4 would strike gold again, but it didn't quite do that. Although there's a great game inside Borderlands 4, it's currently locked inside a vault made of performance issues. While that gets fixed, consider playing the series' best title.Why you should play Tales From The BorderlandsEven a decade after its release, Tales From The Borderlands, Telltale Games' take on the series in modern adventure game form, remains one of the best and funniest story-based games out there. https://youtu.be/MTnFNVojAgcLet's address the elephant in the room head-on. Tales From The Borderlands is not a shooter like the games in the main series. If you're looking for looter-shooter action specifically, this might not be the game for you. But if you're looking for something with the best brand of that specific Borderlands flavor in existence, then this absolutely is the game for you.One of my problems with the Borderlands series is the oftentimes too raunchy comedy, which might've felt great upon the original game's release, but hasn't aged all that gracefully. Tales doesn't suffer from that problem, though, as the Telltale people wisely experimented with the funniest parts of the universe and did without most juvenile elements present in the main series. Tales follows Rhys and Fiona, two uneasy allies played by Troy Baker and Laura Bailey, respectively, as they go searching for a legendary vault. That's regular Borderlands fare, but the simple fact that we now have a two main character dynamic provides comedic gold at every twist and turn. On top of that, these characters are joined by a massive cast of new characters, all of which are absolutely unforgettable.The most common complaint regarding Telltale Games is how it has players make decisions that have no bearing on the outcome. While Tales isn't entirely free from that issue, it's their game where the players' input will have more influence over the course of the game. Also, the ending provides a spectacular climax following up on one of the greatest twist reveals in gaming, so there's that.But what if you need a shooter to scratch the Borderlands 4 itch?The good news for fans of Borderlands is it has inspired a bunch of fantastic games ever since the release of the original title. Players who want to try similar shooters not based in this universe can find a lot of enjoyment in games such as Destiny 2, The Division, and, the best of the bunch as of this writing, Warframe.Whatever the case may be, don't let the possible disappointment lingering over Borderlands 4 stress you out too much. There are plenty of fantastic alternatives out there, and so long as you're open to embracing a different type of game in the same universe, you'll have a blast with Tales From The Borderlands.Like our content?
