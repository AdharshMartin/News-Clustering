Fake Students Plague California Community Colleges, Displacing Real Enrollees	Fake Students Plague California Community Colleges, Displacing Real Enrollees Authored by Kimberley Hayek via The Epoch Times,California’s community colleges are grappling with a surge in fraudulent enrollments, with 1.2 million fake applicants last year accounting for nearly 30 percent of new students, blocking real students from classes and costing millions in stolen financial aid, according to college officials.The problem, exacerbated by the shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, affects at least 90 of the state’s 116 campuses, said Marvin Martinez, chancellor of the Rancho Santiago Community College District, and Jeannie Kim, president of Santiago Canyon College.Before the pandemic, most classes were in-person, making fraud more difficult, Martinez said. But with 80 percent of courses moving online, bots and fake students can enroll from anywhere, including other states or countries.“It’s happened on a massive scale,” Martinez told Epoch TV’s California Insider host Siyamak Khorrami.“What’s made this situation of fraudulent enrollment so different than anything that I’ve seen before in my 36 years in higher ed is that it’s happened in almost 80 percent now of the campuses.”At Santiago Canyon College, fall 2024 enrollment initially spiked 10 percent to 13 percent, Kim said, but faculty discovered many registrants were fraudulent. In one anthropology course, administrators raised the enrollment cap by 30 daily, only for bots to fill slots instantly, leaving just 12 to 15 genuine students. Faculty identified fakes through non-engagement, identical assignments, or invalid contact details, like phone numbers tied to businesses or defunct entities. Removing fraudulent enrollments cut the college’s headcount by 10,000 to 12,000 spots, with some bad actors enrolled in up to five classes each.The fallout is severe. Real students are denied access to required courses, delaying graduations, certificates, and transfers to four-year universities.“Counselors saw the crestfallen faces of students unable to get classes they needed to graduate,” Kim said.Among faculty, morale has gone down as classes shrink to single digits, making them cost-inefficient yet necessary for student progress. “Faculty teach because they love their discipline, but it’s devastating to see classes dwindle,” Kim added. Low-enrollment classes were allowed to run, doubling budgetary strain to prioritize student needs. Financially, colleges face significant losses. California funds community colleges based on enrollment, but removing fake students can cut revenue by up to 23 percent, Martinez said. “You can’t get paid for fake enrollments,” he noted.“It’s better to make that cut upfront than face audits later.”In 2024, scammers stole $8.4 million in federal aid and $2.7 million in state aid, with losses since 2021 exceeding $18 million, state reports show. The colleges reported 20 to 25 identity theft cases, requiring notifications to victims and reports to the U.S. Department of Education.Fraud motivations include exploiting Pell Grants, with “Pell runners” collecting up to $7,400 before vanishing, and harvesting personal data such as Social Security numbers for identity theft, Martinez said. Perpetrators, often international, use AI tools such as ChatGPT to mimic students, targeting no-prerequisite courses such as accounting or business. To combat the issue, colleges are deploying LightLeap.AI, an artificial intelligence platform from N2N Services, initially developed for course predictions but adapted for fraud detection.Santiago Canyon adopted it for under $100,000 after Kim discovered it at a conference, and it is now scaled to 80 campuses statewide at about $75,000 per institution.Processing nearly 3 million applications and flagging 360,000 suspected fraudsters, LightLeap.AI uses machine learning to analyze shared phone numbers, IP addresses, minimal application data, and suspicious course-taking patterns, achieving a 99 percent accuracy rate at Santiago Canyon. “One art faculty member was ecstatic, saying, ‘I have a clean roster. They’re all real,’” Kim recalled.LightLeap.AI’s triangulation method cross-references application data with student information systems and proprietary blacklist/whitelist databases, identifying patterns such as multiple applications from one IP address. Operating in three stages—application, registration, and financial aid—it catches twice as many scammers as manual methods, freeing 7,500 seats for real students at Santiago Canyon. Its network effect allows fraud detection at one college to flag bad actors across 83 campuses, with a 92.3 percent effectiveness rate at West Valley-Mission. The system adapts to evolving tactics by incorporating geolocation data and reducing false positives through continuous learning. Since its intersession rollout, it has been applied across spring, summer, and fall terms, with updates to counter fraudsters’ use of generative AI.Implementing LightLeap.AI presents challenges.“We need tech-savvy staff, but community colleges can’t compete with tech industry salaries,” Martinez said. Budgets, unchanged in 20 years, hinder hiring, and manual verification tools like ID.me are voluntary and inadequate. A proposed $10 application fee, discussed in 2025, aims to deter fraud but risks burdening vulnerable students such as the homeless or undocumented, who struggle with ID verification. Online education is essential for working adults, who now outnumber recent high school graduates enrolled at community colleges. “Adult students—parents with jobs and bills—rely on online classes,” Martinez said. To support this shift, he urged Sacramento to increase funding for technology and staffing. “If it doesn’t happen, we’re going to keep losing money,” he warned. A 2025 state audit is evaluating fraud trends and mitigation effectiveness to guide future funding.“We’re easy prey because bureaucracies react slowly,” Martinez said.Kim emphasized ethical duty: “We’re public servants with a moral obligation to protect taxpayer dollars.” California community colleges serve about 1.8 million students annually, offering low-cost pathways to degrees and jobs. Tyler DurdenSat, 09/06/2025 - 11:40	zerohedge	https://www.zerohedge.com/political/fake-students-plague-california-community-colleges-displacing-real-enrollees	2025-09-06 15:40:00	Fake Students Plague California Community Colleges, Displacing Real Enrollees Fake Students Plague California Community Colleges, Displacing Real Enrollees Authored by Kimberley Hayek via The Epoch Times,California’s community colleges are grappling with a surge in fraudulent enrollments, with 1.2 million fake applicants last year accounting for nearly 30 percent of new students, blocking real students from classes and costing millions in stolen financial aid, according to college officials.The problem, exacerbated by the shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, affects at least 90 of the state’s 116 campuses, said Marvin Martinez, chancellor of the Rancho Santiago Community College District, and Jeannie Kim, president of Santiago Canyon College.Before the pandemic, most classes were in-person, making fraud more difficult, Martinez said. But with 80 percent of courses moving online, bots and fake students can enroll from anywhere, including other states or countries.“It’s happened on a massive scale,” Martinez told Epoch TV’s California Insider host Siyamak Khorrami.“What’s made this situation of fraudulent enrollment so different than anything that I’ve seen before in my 36 years in higher ed is that it’s happened in almost 80 percent now of the campuses.”At Santiago Canyon College, fall 2024 enrollment initially spiked 10 percent to 13 percent, Kim said, but faculty discovered many registrants were fraudulent. In one anthropology course, administrators raised the enrollment cap by 30 daily, only for bots to fill slots instantly, leaving just 12 to 15 genuine students. Faculty identified fakes through non-engagement, identical assignments, or invalid contact details, like phone numbers tied to businesses or defunct entities. Removing fraudulent enrollments cut the college’s headcount by 10,000 to 12,000 spots, with some bad actors enrolled in up to five classes each.The fallout is severe.

Tylenol maker’s stock dips after report says RFK Jr.’s HHS plans to link the drug to autism	The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is planning to release a report that will reportedly link autism and acetaminophen use in pregnancy, according to The Wall Street Journal. The department has confirmed a report is in the works, but has not revealed its conclusions. Drug maker Kenvue, which sells acetaminophen under the brand name Tylenol, saw its shares slump following the Journal’s report, dropping more than 10% on Friday.Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ihas made investigating autism a cornerstone of his efforts at the department. According to the Journal, the report will also make a link between folate deficiency and autism. But in statements to other media outlets, an HHS spokesperson said the Journal’s reporting was “speculation.” “We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America’s unprecedented rise in autism rates,” a spokesperson for the department said.What the science says about acetaminophen and autismSome studies have found correlations between taking the common painkiller in pregnancy and the risk of children developing neurodevelopmental conditions. But these studies don’t prove a link, and other results suggest otherwise: A 2024 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) study—the largest on acetaminophen to date—found that there was no association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and increased risk of autism, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, or intellectual disability. The report comes months after Kennedy promised HHS would undertake a “massive testing and research effort” to find a cause for autism as soon as September. A mountain of research suggests that autism has no single cause, but is likely a combination of factors, including genetics. Kennedy has since walked that timeline back, telling CNN, “it will probably take us another six months.” No proven linkTylenol’s maker Kenvue told Fast Company in a statement that there is no proven link between acetaminophen and autism. “To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and leading medical organizations agree on the safety of acetaminophen, its use during pregnancy, and the information provided on the label.”“We advise expecting mothers to speak to their healthcare professionals before taking any over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, as they are best positioned to advise their patients on whether taking acetaminophen is appropriate based on their unique medical conditions.” The FDA has not found any “clear evidence” that acetaminophen during pregnancy “causes adverse pregnancy, birth, neurobehavioral, or developmental outcomes.” It also recommends that pregnant persons talk to their care providers before using any medications.Fast Company reached out to the department of Health and Human Services for comment, but did not hear back by the time of publication.	fastcompany	https://www.fastcompany.com/91399701/tylenol-stock-dips-report-rfkjr-hhs-link-acetaminophen-autism	2025-09-06 15:40:00	Tylenol maker’s stock dips after report says RFK Jr.’s HHS plans to link the drug to autism The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is planning to release a report that will reportedly link autism and acetaminophen use in pregnancy, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Darksiders 4: Release Date Info, Story, Trailer, And Everything Else We Know	"Darksiders 4 was officially announced in 2025 during a showcase for developer THQ Nordic, and many longtime fans of the franchise are curious about its release date, story, and gameplay. The last time we saw the Darksiders franchise was in 2019 with the release of Darksiders Genesis, a prequel to the original trilogy. This game was met with positive reviews from critics and fans alike, but after radio silence from THQ Nordic for several years, many players thought it could be the last time we'd see the Four Horsemen in action.Now, with Darksiders 4 confirmed, we finally get to see what THQ Nordic has been cooking up all of this time. We know the Four Horsemen are returning and picking up where they left off at the conclusion of the original Darksiders, but what else do we know about the fourth installment in the franchise? You can check out everything we know about Darksiders 4 in the guide below.When will Darksiders 4 be released?While we did get the reveal of Darksiders 4, THQ Nordic still has not given us a release date for the new action-RPG. Right now, the current release date is ""to be announced,"" and there's no indication as to when an announcement is expected.So, as of right now, we're pretty much in the dark when it comes to a release date for Darksiders 4. It's unclear how far along in development THQ Nordic is with the game, either, so we don't have anything to go on at the time of writing.Preorder Darksiders 4As we don't have a concrete release date for Darksiders 4, there's currently no way to preorder the game on any of its available platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S). This also means we don't know how much Darksiders 4 will cost. However, Darksiders has, in recent years, usually been priced under the industry standard for a new AAA game. For example, Darksiders III retailed for $40 at launch, and Darksiders Genesis came in at $30. THQ Nordic could take that same approach with Darksiders 4, which would put it at around $50-60, but it might also be a full-priced, $70 game.All you can do right now is wishlist the game's Standard Edition on PC via Steam. This gives you a notification when Darksiders 4 officially goes live for preorders.Watch the Darksiders 4 teaserIf you want a small glimpse into what THQ Nordic has in store with Darksiders 4, you can watch the official teaser trailer for the action-RPG below. Naturally, this is only a sneak peek at the game that confirms the return of the Four Horsemen. We'll have to wait for a proper trailer to see exactly what Darksiders 4 will look like.Darksiders 4 PlatformsDarksiders is coming to PC via Steam, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It's currently unknown if THQ Nordic will attempt to port the game to other platforms, such as Nintendo Switch 2, in the future. For now, though, Darksiders 4 will launch for only the current-gen platforms.Darksiders 4 Story, Setting, And CharactersAs we only have a small teaser trailer to go off, we don't know too much about the story of Darksiders 4. We do know that the game picks up at the conclusion of the original Darksiders, though, so the setting will still be the post-apocalyptic version of Earth that's remained prevalent throughout the franchise's life. The developers also said that the setting will take place over different realms within the post-apocalyptic landscape, and each realm has unique bosses, items, and visuals.During the game, you'll get to play as one of the Four Horsemen characters, who have become staples of the franchise. Death, Strife, Fury, and War are back in Darksiders 4, and you can choose which one to play as for a playthrough. Each of the Horsemen features different weapons, abilities, and playstyles, giving you more replayability options for second, third, and fourth playthroughs of the main story.Aside from the Four Horsemen, we're unsure of any additional characters in Darksiders 4. However, with the story starting from the end of the first game, it's a safe bet that some characters from the original will make an appearance.Darksiders 4 Gameplay And MultiplayerWhile we await more details and showcases of Darksiders 4, the developers have given us an idea of how the game will play. Just like the other games in the series, the fourth installment is a third-person action-RPG that emphasizes combat, narrative storytelling, and exploration through a lore-rich world.The combat in Darksiders 4 features up-close melee action and supernatural abilities that each of the characters possesses. These abilities can all likely be used in combat in some fashion, but other abilities could be more useful outside of engagements with enemies. In the case of Strife, we'll also likely be able to use his guns. Building on the cooperative feature in Genesis, it's also been confirmed that Darksiders 4 will support up to four people in cooperative play, with each controller one of the Four Horsemen.THQ Nordic specifies ""traversal and puzzle-solving"" as key components to the game. Darksiders is no stranger to unique movement and puzzles across the post-apocalypse, but the early marketing seems to suggest those elements will play a larger role in Darksiders 4. Some characters might offer more traversal abilities than others, which could give them an edge while exploring the map, while other characters might have abilities that make them tankier in battle.We still don't know a large chunk of how Darksiders 4 will look when it comes to gameplay, but THQ Nordic should be able to build off the foundation from the previous games in the franchise.Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google"	gamespot	https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darksiders-4-release-date-info-story-trailer-and-everything-else-we-know/1100-6534456/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f	2025-09-06 16:00:00	"Darksiders 4: Release Date Info, Story, Trailer, And Everything Else We Know Darksiders 4 was officially announced in 2025 during a showcase for developer THQ Nordic, and many longtime fans of the franchise are curious about its release date, story, and gameplay.

Kaslo woman denied farmers' market stall blames 'spiritually violent people' in court	"A Kootenay woman who claimed that ""spiritually violent people"" were the reason she was refused a stall at the Kaslo Farmers' Market has lost an appeal after she took the matter to the BC Supreme Court.According to a recently published April 15 BC Supreme Court decision, Tamara Patricia Balla filed a BC Human Rights complaint against the Kootenay Lake Services Society and members Patrick Steiner, Kathy Allaire after she was refused a stall at the farmers' market to sell her homemade cards.""The exclusion of my stall was likely because of the interests of spiritually violent people,"" she told the Human Rights Tribunal. ""My knowledge of spiritual violence is such that both respondents will also be harmed spiritually unless the issue of spiritual violence is addressed for all.""The decision said Balla referred to a ""global and personally deeply distressing battle between spiritually violent and spiritually non-violent people."" She claimed the farmers' market's refusal to let her sell handmade cards had discriminated against her on the grounds of ancestry, place of origin, sex, gender identity, religion and political belief.After Balla filed her claim, the Human Rights Tribunal wrote back several times asking her to clarify her complaint.""(You) provided information about your understanding and belief of how spiritually violent persons invade and control spiritually non-violent persons. I am sorry to hear that you are feeling affected in this way. Your amendment appears to be asking the Tribunal to broaden your complaint to address this phenomenon,"" the decision read. ""Your complaint does not fall within the matters that the Tribunal can deal with.""After the Tribunal rejected her case, she wrote back saying the process was unfair and ""torturous.""""The tribunal members that are spiritually violent interfere with the process by using me and the spiritually non-violent population,"" Balla wrote.Undeterred, she appealed, asking for a reconsideration.Again, the Human Rights Tribunal told her it didn't deal with this phenomenon.""Your complaint does not allege facts that could contravene the Human Rights Code, and does not fall within the matters that the (Human Rights) Code can address,"" the Tribunal responded.Clearly undeterred, Balla then took the matter to the BC Supreme Court, asking for a judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.According to the Kootenay newspaper, The Valley Voice, Balla pinned her opening statements to the courthttps://www.valleyvoice.ca/_PDF_2016//ValleyVoice250313.web.pdf on her fence for anyone to look at.""Tamara's Hand Painted Cards"" and ""Crimes Against Humanity resources and information,"" the sign on her fence read.She's also written letters to the same newspaper and the Nelson Starhttps://www.nelsonstar.com/opinion/thoughts-on-the-meaning-of-soul-4897280 about spiritual violence against non-spiritually violent people.In her argument to the BC Supreme Court, Balla said the refusal to permit her to continue to have a card stall at the farmers' market violated her freedom of conscience and expression. ""(I) used the card stall to educate people about the conflict between spiritually violent and non-violent people, and she has, therefore, been prevented from continuing to engage in that sort of education,"" she claimed in the decision.""She also wrote that the process was not only unfair, but torturous, as spiritually violent people were using her mind as though it was a toy,"" BC Supreme Court Justice Lindsay Lyster said in the decision.However, the Justice ruled ""these are not the sorts of concerns"" that fall under the legal definition of procedural unfairness. ""The facts alleged by Ms. Balla related to the invasion and control of spiritually non-violent persons by spiritually violent persons. The facts alleged by Ms. Balla did not relate to acts of discrimination in the areas of employment or services or tenancy on any of the grounds that she relied upon in her complaint form,"" the Justice said.Ultimately, the Justice dismissed her appeal.To contact a reporter for this story, email Ben Bulmermailto:bbulmer@infonews.ca or call (250) 309-5230 or email the editormailto:news@infonews.ca.

“Is talking cringe now?”: Skit about “talking in 2025” goes viral—and the critiques are brutal	"A viral TikTok skit portraying a painfully awkward conversation has set off a wave of generational debate. The clip, from creator Mandy (@guyfieriwhore), shows a young woman shutting down every attempt at small talk, offering no opinions, no reactions, and no engagement. The text overlay on her video reads, ""POV you're trying to talk to people in 2025.""@guyfieriwhore/TikTokViewers linked the exaggerated scene to a real-world communication breakdown among Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Conversations across TikTok and Reddit debated whether younger generations have lost basic social skills, or if deeper cultural and pandemic-driven forces are at play.The TikTok has been viewed over 1.9 million times and has 316,000 likes.A viral skit and generational silenceThe video quickly reached Reddit, where it was reposted to the r/TikTokCringe subreddit. There, users claimed the behavior reflected a real communication breakdown among Gen Z and even Gen Alpha.One college assistant teacher said, ""I can confirm half of the students I have that are 18-20 are like this to talk to."" Another commenter, a body piercer, described younger customers as hiding behind ""this smoke screen of stupidity and ignorance to avoid being seen as cringe."" They added, ""The effect is that everyone under 25 seems 8.""Notably, several people tied this communication style to the pandemic. u/crustation_nation explained, ""I'm gen z and that's exactly how it was when we came back to school from covid. No one was raising their hands, everyone was just quiet."" They remembered answering every teacher’s question just to break the silence. ""Something about this behavior feels so deeply selfish because of the discomfort it causes others.""Teachers, managers, and service workers shared similar frustrations. A community college instructor said even simple icebreaker games failed. Students struggled to find common ground and spoke so softly that responses had to be repeated. A waitress added, ""There's definitely a non-insignificant percentage of Gen Z (and going into Gen Alpha as well) that thinks barely whisper-talking while looking away from you is a great way to communicate."" @guyfieriwhore um...... #foryou #fyp #xybca #college #friends ♬ original sound - mandy Social cues, silence, and influencer cultureThese accounts painted a consistent picture: younger people often whisper, mumble, or refuse eye contact.

Unicef, Ang INK join hands for Hiraya cards	Unicef Philippines, in collaboration with Ang Ilustrador ng Kabataan (Ang INK), launches the Hiraya Collection, a new line of all-occasion cards and merchandise that aims to bring hope to vulnerable children through beautiful, art-filled gifts.The limited-edition collection features unique designs by Ang INK, a collective of children’s illustrators. Hiraya is a Filipino term that signifies deep hope and aspiration and the collection paints an image of a happy childhood every child deserves to experience.Each collectible design is inspired by Ang INK artists’ fondest childhood memories, turning every item into a meaningful gift that connects, celebrates, and gives hope.Iori Espiritu, a ceramic artist and illustrator, designed the “Sama-Sama, Salo-Salo,” which shows children gathering ingredients for a meal, reflecting her hope for children to have proper nutrition or to have access to healthy food.Kat Melo, designer and illustrator, draws from her own childhood memories with her piece called “Sayaw ng Santan.” It captures a moment of playfulness and carefreeness she remembers, weaving together images of children dancing and making bracelets from flowers.Al Estrella, a full-time grade school teacher and an illustrator, chose the subject of education, titling his piece “Pangalawang Tahanan” or “Second Home.” He believes that learning can happen inside and outside the school and that classrooms are children’s second home.In 2024, thanks to generous contributions of supporters, Unicef provided over 26,000 children with emergency supplies after landslides and floods.The Hiraya Collection includes the Unicef Cards for Every Occasion, featuring 12 unique designs. The collection also consists of the Unicef Tote Bag, which comes with a keychain and is available in three different designs for P1,500.Every purchase from the Hiraya Collection supports Unicef’s programs for children in education, health and nutrition, immunization, protection, climate, environment, resilience, and aid in emergencies.The collection is available exclusively on the Unicef Giving Shop (donate.unicef.ph/shop).	manilatimes	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/09/07/the-sunday-times/arts-awake/unicef-ang-ink-join-hands-for-hiraya-cards/2180181	2025-09-06 16:01:00	Unicef, Ang INK join hands for Hiraya cards Unicef Philippines, in collaboration with Ang Ilustrador ng Kabataan (Ang INK), launches the Hiraya Collection, a new line of all-occasion cards and merchandise that aims to bring hope to vulnerable children through beautiful, art-filled gifts.The limited-edition collection features unique designs by Ang INK, a collective of children’s illustrators.

Five things people now remember about Marcos Jr.	EACH Philippine president and his or her presidency leave an indelible mark on the Filipino consciousness that outlives his or her term of office. Memories of that term can harden into myths, sometimes unfairly maligning him or her despite evidence to the contrary. Ultimately, however, history judges a presidency not by facts and figures, but by the lasting impressions passed on by ordinary people to the next generation.This is why I worry that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s presidency may one day be remembered for only five things.First, the high cost of living during his administration, with prices of rice, fuel and everyday necessities rising frequently. Second, the arrest of his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte and transport to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity. Third, the massive floods that swallowed entire neighborhoods in Metro Manila, Bulacan and other parts of the country. Fourth, the large-scale corruption in flood control projects involving officials from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), politicians and contractors. And fifth, the horrendous traffic and vehicular accidents that have killed and injured hundreds.Despite his administration’s manifold accomplishments, President Marcos’ first three years in office have been overshadowed by these five ill-defining impressions. Filipinos were swept up by these crises and controversies, struggling to see any meaningful achievements tied to his eight-point socioeconomic agenda. Do you still recall them?It doesn’t augur well that President Marcos frequently loses the narrative while events unfold and seemingly overwhelm his administration. Even his much-publicized anticorruption campaign targeting the multibillion-peso DPWH flood control projects may have backfired and hurt his administration. By exposing the anomalies, he inadvertently revealed the complicity of his relatives and close allies in Congress. The opposition now smells blood, and the public demands accountability. A prolonged legislative investigation risks unearthing deeper scandals that could trigger mass unrest and lead to an Indonesian-style upheaval.In fact, the midterm “resignations” of top officials in environment, housing, public works, communications, the Philippine National Police and the National Bureau of Investigation do not bode well for investor confidence, which sees his government as unsteady and lacking continuity. It also reflects the President’s poor judgment in appointing unfit people to these critical offices. This is a far cry from his father’s respected Cabinet, which was composed of the brightest technocrats in our era, like Cesar Virata, Roberto Ongpin, Gerardo Sicat, Onofre Corpuz and Jaime Laya.Still, President Marcos has three years left in his term to regain the momentum for his “Bagong Pilipinas” (New Philippines) campaign. The task is daunting, but not impossible. He must assert control over Congress and put an end to these self-serving investigations into the DPWH anomalies. He must direct all prosecuting agencies to file charges against the suspects and promptly put them behind bars, similar to what happened after the pork barrel scam of businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles exploded. The 2026 national budget must be airtight and pork barrel-proof to restore the public trust. Likewise, he must confront the resurgence of crimes like rape, illegal drugs, theft, robbery, murder and digital scams before another crime wave hits his administration. And most crucially, he must rein in the greed of his relatives, friends, campaign donors and political allies that are fueling people’s discontent and disillusionment.If he fails to face and resolve these, then history may indeed reduce his presidency to those five unfortunate memories. His supporters will argue this is unfair. After all, Marcos has been steadfast in defending Philippine sovereignty against Chinese aggression, earning praise here and abroad. The country’s macroeconomic fundamentals have remained stable despite global headwinds like regional conflicts and supply chain disruptions. And his departure from the Duterte administration’s bloody drug war and human rights violations has earned respect even among his fiercest critics.Yet, after three years, what most Filipinos remember are five things: high prices, Duterte’s arrest and transfer, catastrophic floods, rampant corruption, and paralyzing traffic and transportation mess. Fair or not, these adverse impressions threaten to eclipse his broader vision and major achievements as he exits in June 2028.But all is not yet lost. Three years is fast for a transactional and reactive presidency, but it is still long for a transformative and decisive leader. Many Filipinos like myself are fond of underdogs and are now rooting for Marcos, praying that he finds the strength to recover above the disarray, silence his naysayers, and secure his rightful place in the annals of history as one of our greatest presidents.	manilatimes	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/09/07/opinion/columns/five-things-people-now-remember-about-marcos-jr/2180131	2025-09-06 16:01:00	Five things people now remember about Marcos Jr. EACH Philippine president and his or her presidency leave an indelible mark on the Filipino consciousness that outlives his or her term of office.

PHLPost: A strategy lesson in governance	IN a directors’ training program I recently attended, the Philippine Postal Corp. (PHLPost) was presented as a case study. We were tasked with analyzing its performance and proposing solutions. The exercise revealed a company at a crossroads: declining revenues, persistent operating losses, and growing reliance on subsidies and other non-operating income. This is not inherently wrong, but it is risky if it substitutes for much-needed operational transformation.PHLPost is a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) that carries the universal service obligation to deliver mail nationwide, including to remote areas that private couriers often avoid. Yet its mission to serve all Filipinos has not been matched with a vision and strategy that secure its relevance in a digital economy. This misalignment makes the organization appear stuck in the past, unable to redefine its role for the future.From a strategy lens, the gaps become clearer. Using the Balanced Scorecard, we saw weaknesses across multiple perspectives. Financially, revenues have been shrinking year after year. From the customer perspective, PHLPost has lost ground to private couriers who are faster, more flexible, and digitally enabled. Internally, the organization has struggled to modernize its processes. In terms of learning and growth, its workforce lacks the tools and incentives to drive innovation. These weaknesses collectively erode performance and risk further diminishing citizen trust in the government’s capacity to deliver.Execution barriers compound the problem. There is a vision barrier, as the organization has not clearly articulated how it will remain relevant in a digital economy. There is a resource barrier, as it depends heavily on government subsidies. There is a people barrier, with employees often constrained by outdated systems. And there is a management barrier, where compliance tends to dominate over strategy. These barriers make it difficult for PHLPost to turn plans into performance.Culture plays a role as well. PHLPost’s official core values include commitment, innovation, teamwork, entrepreneurial spirit, patriotism, integrity, excellence, and spirituality. While these are noble and comprehensive, the challenge lies in living them out consistently. Values risk remaining words on a wall rather than drivers of transformation.Our group discussions explored possible solutions. Revenue diversification was a priority, shifting from declining mail services to parcel delivery and e-commerce logistics. Asset optimization was another, by leveraging PHLPost’s valuable real estate portfolio for income generation and partnerships. We also stressed digital transformation to bring its services in line with customer expectations for tracking, payments, and online access. Efficiency reforms such as consolidating underutilized post offices and streamlining routes were suggested as well. One practical idea was to adopt the model of private courier services by accrediting third-party riders. This would expand PHLPost’s reach and keep costs competitive while supplementing, not replacing, its workforce.While contexts differ, countries like Singapore Post and Japan Post illustrate how postal systems can reinvent themselves when governance and strategy align. Singapore Post pivoted toward e-commerce logistics, while Japan Post expanded into financial and insurance services. These examples show that transformation is possible when boards actively steer organizations toward future relevance.The PHLPost case also reminded me of the Tricker Model of Governance, which distinguishes between conformance and performance. PHLPost’s board has leaned heavily toward conformance, ensuring processes, compliance, and stakeholder reporting. It has been weaker on performance, where strategy and long-term viability should reside. This raises an important challenge for the board: How can it pivot from compliance oversight to strategic stewardship that reimagines PHLPost’s future? The responsibility for strategy cannot rest solely with management. Boards are duty-bound to look outward and forward, ensuring sustainability and relevance.The lesson for directors is clear. Governance must go beyond checklists and awards. A well-structured board and transparent reports mean little if the organization cannot sustain itself, innovate, and serve its mandate. Strategy is not about incremental improvements but about positioning for the future. For public institutions like PHLPost, this means reconnecting vision, mission, and values to a strategy that delivers outcomes citizens can actually feel. As future directors, we must ensure governance frameworks do not stop at compliance but push organizations to reimagine their relevance and resilience.	manilatimes	https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/09/07/business/sunday-business-it/phlpost-a-strategy-lesson-in-governance/2180091	2025-09-06 16:01:00	PHLPost: A strategy lesson in governance IN a directors’ training program I recently attended, the Philippine Postal Corp.

The constitutional guarantee against imprisonment for debt	Dear PAO,Last year, my father obtained a personal loan amounting to Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (P300,000.00) from a known loan shark. Because he was unexpectedly laid off from work, he was unable to pay the loan when it fell due. Yesterday, two (2) individuals who introduced themselves as law enforcement officers went to our residence and demanded that my father accompany them to the police station. Naturally, he refused, and shortly thereafter, he began receiving a series of text messages containing threats, including a claim that a warrant for his arrest had just been issued and will soon be enforced on account of his failure to settle his debt. Terrified at the thought of being suddenly arrested, my father now refuses to leave the house, let alone go to the police station to report the threats. I just want to know if he can really be arrested and imprisoned for his failure to pay his debt. Thank you.SamDear Sam,Article III, Section 20 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution explicitly provides that “[n]o person shall be imprisoned for debt or nonpayment of a poll tax.” The guarantee of immunity from imprisonment to a person who shall fail to pay his/her debt was “brought about by the force of public opinion which looked with abhorrence on statutory provision which permitted the cruel imprisonment of debtors. The people sought to prevent the use of the power of the State to coerce the payment of debts. The control of the creditor over the person of his debtor was abolished by human statutory and constitutional provisions.” (George H. Ganaway vs. J. W. Quillen, GR 18619, Feb. 20, 1922, Ponente: Associate Justice George Malcolm).In the Quillen case, the Supreme Court shed light on the scope of the constitutional guarantee, essentially limiting its application to civil actions, the object and sole purpose of which is collection of debts. This means that the State is not precluded from prosecuting cases of debt incurred through fraudulent means, i.e., estafa, which remain punishable by imprisonment in our jurisdiction.In your father’s case, the constitutional guarantee against imprisonment for debt renders it highly unlikely, if not impossible, for him to be arrested and imprisoned on account of his mere failure to settle his debt. At most, the only recourse available to the creditor would be the filing of a civil case for collection of sum of money, specifically a small claims case, against your father, following the Rules on Expedited Procedures in the First Level Courts (a.m. 08-8-7-SC dated 1 March 2022), which provides:“RULE I“APPLICABILITY“Section 1. Coverage. – These Rules shall govern the expedited procedures in the Metropolitan Trial Courts (MeTCs), the Municipal Trial Courts in Cities (MTCCs), the Municipal Trial Courts (MTCs) and the Municipal Circuit Trial Courts (MCTCs), for the following cases falling within their jurisdiction: A. CIVIL CASES (1) Summary Procedure Cases, as follows: xxx (2) Small Claims Cases, as defined hereunder, where the claim does not exceed One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00), exclusive of interest and costs.“A ‘small claim’ is an action that is purely civil in nature where the claim or relief raised by the plaintiff is solely for the payment or reimbursement of a sum of money. It excludes actions seeking other claims or reliefs aside from payment or reimbursement of a sum of money and those coupled with provisional remedies.”Consequently, the claim that a warrant for your father’s arrest had been issued is, for all intents and purposes, a sham that should not be given any regard.We hope that we are able to answer your queries.

Because he was unexpectedly laid off from work, he was unable to pay the loan when it fell due. Yesterday, two (2) individuals who introduced themselves as law enforcement officers went to our residence and demanded that my father accompany them to the police station. Naturally, he refused, and shortly thereafter, he began receiving a series of text messages containing threats, including a claim that a warrant for his arrest had just been issued and will soon be enforced on account of his failure to settle his debt. Terrified at the thought of being suddenly arrested, my father now refuses to leave the house, let alone go to the police station to report the threats. I just want to know if he can really be arrested and imprisoned for his failure to pay his debt. Thank you.SamDear Sam,Article III, Section 20 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution explicitly provides that “[n]o person shall be imprisoned for debt or nonpayment of a poll tax.” The guarantee of immunity from imprisonment to a person who shall fail to pay his/her debt was “brought about by the force of public opinion which looked with abhorrence on statutory provision which permitted the cruel imprisonment of debtors. The people sought to prevent the use of the power of the State to coerce the payment of debts. The control of the creditor over the person of his debtor was abolished by human statutory and constitutional provisions.” (George H. Ganaway vs. J. W. Quillen, GR 18619, Feb. 20, 1922, Ponente: Associate Justice George Malcolm).In the Quillen case, the Supreme Court shed light on the scope of the constitutional guarantee, essentially limiting its application to civil actions, the object and sole purpose of which is collection of debts.

Dr Michelle Dickinson: nanotechnologist on the new study revealing eggs don't scramble cholesterol	For years, eggs have been breakfast’s most controversial ingredient. Despite being packed with protein and essential nutrients, they’ve carried the weight of dietary guidelines that linked them to high cholesterol and an increased risk of heart disease. But a new study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition has cracked that myth wide open. The world-first study investigated the independent effects of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat on LDL cholesterol levels. The results: it’s not the cholesterol in eggs that’s the problem, it’s the saturated fat in other parts of our diet, like bacon and sausages. In this controlled trial, researchers assigned participants to diets with varying combinations of cholesterol and saturated fat. In one group, participants consumed two eggs per day as part of a high-cholesterol but low-saturated-fat diet. In another, participants ate high-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol meals. A third group consumed both high saturated fat and high cholesterol. What they found was surprising: LDL cholesterol only rose in diets high in saturated fat regardless of dietary cholesterol intake. But when cholesterol came from eggs in the absence of excess saturated fat, LDL levels actually dropped slightly. This is an important finding because it challenges long-held assumptions in nutritional science. For decades, dietary cholesterol (often from eggs) was lumped in with saturated fats as a heart health hazard. But as this study demonstrates, the two have very different effects on the body. Eggs contain around 186 mg of cholesterol per yolk, which historically raised alarms. However, they are very low in saturated fat (about 1.6 grams per large egg). Saturated fats found in processed meats, butter, and fried foods are the true drivers of increased LDL cholesterol, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. The study reaffirms a growing body of evidence that dietary cholesterol has minimal impact on blood cholesterol in most people, especially when consumed as part of a healthy, balanced diet. The key takeaway isn’t just that eggs are safe, it’s that context matters. A couple of eggs at breakfast is fine. A couple of eggs alongside bacon, sausages, and buttered toast? Not so much. It’s the overall pattern of your diet, not individual foods, that makes the biggest difference to your heart health. So feel free to enjoy your poached, scrambled, or sunny-side-up eggs. Just remember: it’s the saturated fat, not the eggs, that’s more likely to scramble your cholesterol.LISTEN ABOVE	newstalkzb	https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/the-sunday-session/audio/dr-michelle-dickinson-nanotechnologist-on-the-new-study-revealing-eggs-dont-scramble-cholesterol/	2025-09-06 23:42:32	Dr Michelle Dickinson: nanotechnologist on the new study revealing eggs don't scramble cholesterol For years, eggs have been breakfast’s most controversial ingredient.

'We're going to flood the zone': Trump officials plot at event 'filled with extremists'	The Guardian reports the Friday National Conservatism Conference in Washington, D.C. hosted a wide variety of far-right religious extremists, from men-only secret societies to theocratic right-wing pundits and associations.Other event speakers were closely associated with the secretive Society for American Civic Renewal (SACR), an invitation-only, Christian ultra-nationalist network with “undercurrents of neo-fascist accelerationism,” according to a Middlebury Institute report.Mingling and mixing among the theocrats, however, were Trump officials.READ MORE: 'Whiplash': Insider says Trump 'knows where things stand' — and it’s killing him“NatCon is filled with extremists touting white nationalism and conspiracy theories,” said Heidi Beirich, the chief strategy officer and co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “What is notable is how Trump administration officials and allies are key players in the event, showing that it is near impossible today to distinguish the far right from the administration.”One speech by White house “border czar” Tom Homan contained warnings for the city of Chicago, which Trump is threatening to douse with federal agents and national guard troops, as he already has in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.“I said two months ago, we’re going to flood the zone and that’s exactly what we’re doing,” Homan told the crowd. “In Chicago, it’s coming. So, watch what happens in the very near future.”The Guardian reports Trump’s deputy attorney general, Harmeet Dhillon, gave her own speech in which she characterized the justice department’s civil rights division as “the president’s shock troops.”READ MORE: Trump discovers rejection on the world stage — because of his 'weak mind': analysis“We’re the front guard.

Middle East M&A Volume Climbs Amid Global Decline	Deal volumes across the Middle East hit 271 in the first half of 2025, up from 228 a year earlier, defying a 9 per cent contraction in global M&A activity. The region owes this strong performance to sovereign capital, regulatory reforms, and strategic investments in high-growth sectors. Middle East M&A Volume Climbs Amid Global Decline now captures the robust upswing.Driving this growth are the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which together accounted for 89 per cent of all regional deals, contributing 240 of the total 271 transactions. Egypt posted the most dramatic year-on-year increase, Saudi Arabia held firm, and the UAE maintained its dominance as a key investment hub. These three markets continue to anchor regional momentum with consistent activity. Deal dynamics reveal a marked tilt toward mid-market transactions. About 96 per cent of disclosed deals were valued under USD 100 million, and no megadeals—those above USD 5 billion—were recorded for the second consecutive half-year. Investors clearly favour less capital-intensive, faster-closing acquisitions aligned with national economic goals. Sovereign wealth funds are pivotal in sustaining this resilience. Investors such as Abu Dhabi’s ADQ channelled up to 85 per cent of funds into domestic projects, reinforcing economic diversification and localisation drives. Corporate buyers led 154 deals, while private equity maintained strong representation with 117 deals, underscoring balanced market participation. Thematic trends highlight technology, energy transition, and healthcare as key catalysts. Landmark transactions include G42’s USD 2.2 billion acquisition of a 40 per cent stake in Khazna Data Centers, and Saudi Arabia’s USD 907 million Elm Co acquisition of Thiqah Business Services—both reflecting long-term strategic priorities. Intra-regional and domestic deal flow gained traction, with 134 transactions recorded, up from 118 in H1 2024, while outbound cross-border deals continued to wane. This signals increasing investor confidence in local markets and a pivot to regionally self-sufficient economic strategies. Each country brings distinct strengths: the UAE, with 95 deals, remains the most active hub, thanks to its flexible regulatory environment and sector diversity; Saudi Arabia, with 59 deals, benefits from Vision 2030 reforms and steady non-oil growth; and Egypt, surging to 86 deals, is boosted by IMF support, tax modernisation and renewed investor trust. Globally, M&A volumes declined by 9 per cent in H1 2025—a stark contrast to the Middle East’s 19 per cent rise. The gulf underscores the region’s adaptive capacity and alignment with broader economic transformation goals.The post Middle East M&A Volume Climbs Amid Global Decline appeared first on Arabian Post.	thearabianpost	https://thearabianpost.com/middle-east-ma-volume-climbs-amid-global-decline/	2025-09-08 04:04:00	Middle East M&A Volume Climbs Amid Global Decline Deal volumes across the Middle East hit 271 in the first half of 2025, up from 228 a year earlier, defying a 9 per cent contraction in global M&A activity.

GCC Banks Post Record-High Quarterly Profits	Net profits for banks listed across the Gulf Cooperation Council surged to an unprecedented $16.6 billion in the second quarter, marking the second straight quarter of gains and a sequential increase of roughly 3.7 %, with year-on-year growth at a robust 9.2 %, according to Kamco Invest. This performance was driven by broadly higher revenues and a lower cost-to-income ratio that more than compensated for a rise in impairments. Lending activity remained resilient, underpinned by strong economic fundamentals and a pipeline of projects in the region.Banks across the GCC achieved strong growth, with net profits rising 10.3 % year-on-year to $16.6 billion in Q2 2025, according to the latest Kamco Invest analysis. The sequential increase of about 3.7 % was fuelled by a broad-based rise in revenues, while a leaner cost-to-income ratio offset the impact of elevated impairments. Lending growth persisted, reflecting healthy demand and continued economic momentum.Abu Dhabi led regional outperformers as its banks posted aggregate Q2 earnings of $3.2 billion—a 23.1 % rise compared to the year before. First Abu Dhabi Bank stood out with a 29.4 % surge in quarterly net profits to $1.5 billion, supported by stronger non-interest income and lower impairment charges. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank also delivered solid gains, buoyed by elevated interest and fee income.Dubai’s banks, by contrast, experienced a contraction: aggregate city-listed earnings fell by 6.4 % to $3.2 billion, weighed down by increased impairments at major lenders such as Emirates NBD. Some resilience came from Commercial Bank of Dubai, which posted a 15.4 % rise, alongside a surge in real-estate and utilities profits—Emaar Properties and DEWA among the top performers.Among other GCC markets, Q2 net profits for Oman-listed banks were around $1 billion, while those in Qatar also posted gains, contributing to the overall strength in the banking sector.The headline figure—$16.6 billion in quarterly profit for GCC banks—captures the scale of the region’s banking sector resilience. This strong performance highlights how GCC banks post record-high quarterly profits, powered by sustained credit growth and operational efficiencies even amid higher impairments.--The post GCC Banks Post Record-High Quarterly Profits appeared first on Arabian Post.	thearabianpost	https://thearabianpost.com/gcc-banks-post-record-high-quarterly-profits/	2025-09-08 04:04:00	GCC Banks Post Record-High Quarterly Profits Net profits for banks listed across the Gulf Cooperation Council surged to an unprecedented $16.6 billion in the second quarter, marking the second straight quarter of gains and a sequential increase of roughly 3.7 %, with year-on-year growth at a robust 9.2 %, according to Kamco Invest.
